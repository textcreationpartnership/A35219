            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is a common Imputation caſt upon <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> by Forreigners, that they are more ſolicitous to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Affairs and Tranſactions of other Nations and Countreys, than to be throughly informed of the moſt remarkable Paſſages which have happened in their own; though I muſt aſſert, that I am not of their Opinion, ſince having already publiſhed three ſmall Tracts of the ſame price with this; one called, <hi>Admirable Curioſities, Rarities, and Wonders in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> England, &amp;c. Another <hi>Hiſtorical Remarks of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter: And a third Intituled, <hi>The Wars in</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>in the Reign of K.</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt:</hi> I have found they have received very great acceptation with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſo that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands more of them have been vended, than of others which have concerned Forreign Matters; this gives me incouragement to emit this brief Collection of the most memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

Occurrences during the Reigns of the Monarchs of <hi>England,</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Invaſion to this preſent, wherein I have purpoſely omitted ſeveral very conſiderable Paſſages, as being already inſerted in the three Books aforementioned, ſo that theſe four may now be reckoned to give a very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory account of all remarkable Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Accidents in <hi>England</hi> for near ſixteen hundred years paſt, which muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be very diverting, ſince at ſo ſmall a price, any Perſon may be accommodated with ſo many uſeful particulars both for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Diſcourſe, and may likewiſe obſerve, that our Anceſtors wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Wiſdom, Conduct, and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of this celebrated Age, and ought not therefore to be reckoned ſo rude and barbarous as our brisk and gentiel Wits are apt (through ignorance, and in obſervance) to imagine they were, ſince we may find the Policy, Valour, and Clemency of the most renowned <hi>Roman</hi> Heroes to be matcht, if not outdone by many of our noble <hi>Engliſh</hi> Worthies; which may be a ſufficient encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirit to read the following Manual, and thereby oblige,</p>

               <hi>ENGLANDS</hi> MONARCHS: Or, An Account of the KINGS of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> From the Invaſion of the <hi>ROMANS</hi> to this Time.</head>
            <p>HIſtorians conjecture, That <hi>Britain</hi> was inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited before <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood; and <hi>Jeffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> relates. That it was Peopled by <hi>Brute</hi> with his <hi>Trojans,</hi> about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after: But others think the whole of theſe Relations to be meerly Fabulous, affirming, That the firſt Inhabitants thereof were derived from the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> by reaſon of their Agreement in Laws, Cuſtoms, Speech, Buildings, and other Uſages; though we may judge, that being meerly Barbarous, they took no care to tranſmit their Original to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; or, if they had writ any thing, it would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been loſt in ſo long a time, and ſuch great Alterations of Affairs. Therefore the ſmall Light we have concerning them, is borrowed from Foreign Writers; of which I ſhall give this brief Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57813:4"/>The Ancient <hi>Britans</hi> painted their naked Bodies with divers Pictures of Living Creatures, Flowers, Sun, Moon, and Stars, thereby, as they imagined, to appear more dreadful to their Adverſaries: yet ſome of the Civiler ſort were clothed; and, as a great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, they wore Chains of Iron about their Waſtes and Necks, and Rings on their middle Fingers. The Hair of their Head they wore long, which was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally curled in many; all other Parts they ſhaved, onely the upper Lip. They had ten or twelve Wives apiece, who lived in common among their Parents and Brethren; yet the Children were onely accounted his who firſt married the Mother while ſhe was a Maid: They were brought up in common amongſt them. They were moderate in their Diet, as Milk, Roots, and Barks of Trees, and a little thing no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a Bean, which for a great while took away both Hunger and Thirſt: Neither would they eat Hens, Hares, Geeſe, nor Fiſh; yet would often dine upon Veniſon and Fruits. Their uſual Drink was made of Barley. They are reported by <hi>Plutarch</hi> to have lived very long, many to an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</p>
            <p>They were Idolatrous Heathens as to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, uſing Mans Fleſh in their Sacrifices, and adoring a multitude of Idols. Their Prieſts were called <hi>Druids,</hi> who managed their Sacrifices, and likewiſe acted as Temporal Judges in all Civil Matters; and it was highly criminal not to abide by their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were excuſed from the Wars, and all Contributions. They had a Primate, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them in Chief. Their Divinity was, <hi>That the Soul is Immortal, and paſſeth from one Body to another:</hi> Which Doctrine they taught not out of Books, but by Word of Mouth. Their Buildings were low, mean Cottages, like thoſe of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or Boors of <hi>France;</hi> yet they fortified ſeveral thick Woods with Rampiers and Ditches, which they called Towns.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57813:4"/>
Braſs and Iron Rings were the Coin they uſed, which were of a certain weight; but afterward they grew more Civil by Traffick, and had both Gold and Silver Money. Their chief Trade was in Chains, Wreaths, Ivory Boxes, Bits and Bridles, with ſome Toys of Amber and Glaſs. Neither was their Shipping more conſiderable, their chief Veſſels being made of light Wood, covered over with Leather. Their uſual way of Fighting was in Military Chariots; neither did they engage in great Bodies, but had ſtill freſh Men to ſucceed thoſe who retired, or were weary. Their Weapons were Shields, and ſhort Spears, at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end whereof was faſtned a round Bell of Braſs, with which they terrified their Enemies. Many times they fought under the Conduct of Valiant Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were extraordinary Courageous. They managed their Chariots ſo dexterouſly, that running down a ſteep Hill with all ſpeed, they could ſtop them in the middle of their Courſe.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt arrived here, the Iſland was divided into <hi>Britannia Prima,</hi> which contained the South part of <hi>England; Britannia Secunda</hi> was the Weſtern part, now called <hi>Wales;</hi> and <hi>Maxima Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſis,</hi> which comprehended all the Northern parts beyond the River <hi>Trent.</hi> The firſt of which in the <hi>Britains</hi> time belonged to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> the ſecond, to that of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> or <hi>Glamorgan;</hi> the third, to that of <hi>York. Julius Caeſar,</hi> the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoverer thereof, really imagined that he had found a New World, it being one of the greateſt Iſlands in the Univerſe. It was formerly called <hi>Samothea</hi> from <hi>Samothes</hi> (as ſome report) the ſixth Son of <hi>Japhet,</hi> who firſt inhabited here, two hundred fifty two years after the Flood. It was alſo named <hi>Albion,</hi> (as is ſaid) from <hi>Albion</hi> a Giant, the Son of <hi>Neptune;</hi> who after he had conquered the <hi>Samotheans,</hi> ſetled here, three hundred thirty five years after the Deluge. Some ſay it was called <hi>Albion ab albis Rupibus,</hi> from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57813:5"/>
white Rocks toward <hi>France,</hi> which is moſt probable. The <hi>Grecians</hi> called it <hi>Britain,</hi> for what Reaſon we know not; it may be from <hi>Prittannia,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Metals,</hi> they finding the Iſland full of Braſs, Tin, Iron, Gold, Silver, and Lead. Laſtly, It was named <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from <hi>Engloen</hi> a Place in <hi>Denmark,</hi> which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changed by the <hi>Danes</hi> nor <hi>Normans,</hi> and retained that Title eight hundred ſeventy three years, till King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown, and united <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is ſince called <hi>Great Britain.</hi> It was accounted the Fortunate Iſland; and Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, was ſo in love with it, that he would fain have come over to ſee it, if the King would have permitted it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> is thought to have embraced Chriſtianity about ſixty three years after Chriſt, in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time; and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> was ſent by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Philip</hi> to preach the Goſpel here; yea, ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That both St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> were here likewiſe: though theſe are onely Conjectures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> tells us, That when he entred this Iſland, they were not under one ſole King or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, but divided into no leſs than twenty eight petty Kingdoms or Provinces. The moſt memorable of their Princes who oppoſed the Conqueſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> are theſe following. 1. <hi>Caſſibelan,</hi> King of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> who inhabited <hi>Middleſex, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Hartfordſhire:</hi> For about the Year of the Worlds Creation 3913. and fifty four years before the Birth of Chriſt, the Fortunate <hi>Romans,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> firſt landed about <hi>Deal</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> the News whereof was ſo exceeding welcome to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senate, that they decreed a Thankſgiving for twenty days; an Honour never granted to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the greateſt Victors having had but five, or at moſt but ten days aſſigned them: At which time <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> was choſen by general Conſent to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Roman</hi> Invaſion; which he did with very

            <p>Theſe, with divers other Princes, were very ſtout Defenders of their Country and Liberties againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, for above an hundred years; neither had they been then ſubdu'd, but by the unhappy Quarrels and Diviſions among themſelves, whereby their Enemies took the advantage to ruin them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and become their Maſters.

               <hi>That it was more profitable for the State, that the Wealth of the Land ſhould be diſperſed into the Commons Hands, than to lie locked up in the Princes Coffers.</hi> He was ſo averſe to Superfluity, that he had ſcarce Neceſſaries; but herein he chiefly excelled, that he protected the poor Chriſtians, who were under a bloody Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Diocleſian</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyrant; he made his Court their Sanctuary: And to try the ſincerity of their Profeſſion, he uſed <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Policy, commanding all his Officers and Servants to offer Sacrifice to the Heathen Gods, and threatning to diſcard the Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; but, on the contrary, he rejected all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, with this Reflection, <hi>That he who is diſloyal to his God, can never be faithful to his Prince,</hi> Whilſt he was Governour here under the Emperour <hi>Aurelian,</hi> he married <hi>Helena</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Coelius</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Prince, who converted him to Chriſtianity, on whom he begot <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> in <hi>Britain.</hi> After he was Emperour he came hither, and fought againſt the <hi>Picts;</hi> but returning from that Expedition, he fell ſick at <hi>York,</hi> which was his Imperial Seat: At which time his Son <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came thither to him, at the ſight of whom being much comforted, he ſate up in his Bed, and ſpake to this effect: <hi>It now ſufficeth, and Death is not terrible to me, ſince I ſhall leave my Actions not yet accompliſhed unto thee, my Son, to be performed; in whoſe Perſon I doubt not but that my Memory ſhall be preſerved, as in a Monument of ſucceeding Fame.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57813:6"/>The afore-mentioned Perſecution under <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian</hi> was very grievous: It was called the Tenth Perſecution, and continued for ten years, with ſo great rage, that within one Months time ſeventeen thouſand Chriſtians were put to death, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of others cruelly uſed, though eſcaping with their Lives. And as in other Places, ſo in <hi>Britain,</hi> the Churches of the Chriſtians were demoliſhed, their Bibles burnt, and their Bodies maſſacred; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers being killed at <hi>St. Albars,</hi> and other Places: yea, ſo many ſuffered at <hi>Lichfield,</hi> that the Place became like another <hi>Golgotha;</hi> upon which account that City hath for its Arms a Field of Blood, whereon are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Martyrs. But the chief Cauſe of theſe Miſeries proceeded from the Chriſtians themſelves: <q>For (ſaith the famous <hi>Euſebius</hi>) after our Converſation was through too much Liberty and Licentiouſneſs degenerated, and Holineſs of Life neglected, whilſt we did envy, bite, and backbite each other, raiſing inteſtine War, and wounding one another with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious Words; whilſt nothing but Hypocriſie was in the Face, Deceit in the Heart, and Guile on the Tongue, whereby Vengeance and Wrath was come to the height; even then it was that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Hand of God began to viſit us. Nevertheleſs, when God had done uſing theſe his Rods of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he caſt them into the Fire; for theſe two Emperours having renounced the Empire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again become Private Men. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> poyſoned himſelf, and <hi>Maximinian</hi> hanged himſelf.</q>

               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was the laſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours that had Power in <hi>Britain,</hi> which was in the Year of Chriſt 423. For about this time the <hi>Goths,</hi> who had faithfully ſerved the <hi>Romans</hi> above twenty years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſobliged and ſlighted, to revenge their Wrongs they choſe for their Leader a violent <hi>Goth</hi> called <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,</hi> who ſhortly after proved the Scourge of <hi>Rome:</hi> For the <hi>Vandals, Alans,</hi> and <hi>Suecians</hi> joyning with him, they began a fierce War in <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> increaſing their Forces into ſuch vaſt Multitudes, that the World ſtood amazed and trembled at them. For ſoon after two hundred thouſand <hi>Goths</hi> more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to them, who with theſe united Forces over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run <hi>Thracia, Hungary, Auſtria, Sclavonia,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> ruining and deſtroying all things in ſo dreadful a manner, that it ſeemed rather the Ravage of Devils than Men. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire thus declining, they drew their Forces out of <hi>Britain:</hi> But a while after the <hi>Britans</hi> were extremely diſtreſſed by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Diſturbers of their Peace, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> therefore they ſent their Ambaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57813:7"/>
their Garments rent, and Duſt upon their Heads, bewailing their moſt miſerable Condition, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Aſſiſtance; whereupon the Emperour ſent a Regiment of Soldiers into <hi>Britain,</hi> under <hi>Gallio,</hi> who for a while ſecured them, but was ſoon called back with his Legion into <hi>France,</hi> to ſecure the Country about <hi>Paris.</hi> At his departure he adviſed the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> to ſtand upon their Guard, and for the future to provide for their own Safety, and not to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Succours from the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had their Hands full of Troubles nearer home.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Romans,</hi> after they had commanded in <hi>Britain</hi> about five hundred years, took their laſt Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel thereof.

               <p>This was uſually called the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy,</hi> or Seven Kingdoms.

               <p>Yet during the time of this <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> many of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes valiantly defended their lawful Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, and with great Courage endeavoured to prevent the <hi>Saxon</hi> Yoke from being impoſed upon their Necks: Among whom was <hi>Vortimer,</hi> the Son of <hi>Vortigern</hi> afore-mentioned; for <hi>Vortigern</hi> being after ſixteen years Reign depoſed from the Government, for his Kindneſs to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> his Son <hi>Vortimer</hi> was choſen King of the <hi>Britans,</hi> and preſently engaged againſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> gaining ſo much in four famous Victories over them, that they were almoſt extirpated.

               <p>Yet the <hi>Saxons,</hi> according to the common Fate of Conquerours, after they had ſubdued their Enemies, diſagreed among themſelves, and ſeveral of their Princes incroached upon the Territories of each other, and ſo became petty Monarchs of ſome part of <hi>Britain:</hi> Theſe were reckoned to be fourteen in number, till at laſt <hi>Egbert,</hi> the eighteenth King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> got command over all the ſeven Kingdoms of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſo became ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of <hi>England,</hi> which none of his Predeceſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever obtained.

This virtuous Prince divided the twenty four Hours of the Day and Night into three equal Parts, which he obſerved by the burning of a Taper ſet in his Chappel, Clocks and Watches being not then in uſe: Eight Hours he ſpent in Contemplation, Reading, and Prayer; other eight, for his Repoſe, and the Neceſſaries of Life; and the other eight, in Affairs of State. He divided the Kingdom into Shires, Hundreds, and Tythings, for the better Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, and ſuppreſſing of Robbers and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons; which had ſo good effect, that the People might travel with all manner of ſecurity: yea, ſaith my Author, if Bracelets of Gold had been hung in the High-ways, none durſt have preſumed to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them away. He commanded all his Subjects who poſſeſſed two Hides of Land, to bring up their Sons in Learning till they were at leaſt fifteen years old, aſſerting, <hi>That he accounted a Man Free-born, and yet Illiterate, to be no better than a Beaſt, a Sot, and a Brainleſs Creature:</hi> Neither would he admit any into

Office that were not ſo. He tranſlated the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, was devout in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and a great Protector of Widows and Orphans.</p>

                  <hi>Edward</hi> his eldeſt Son ſucceeded him, againſt whom his Nephew <hi>Ethelwald</hi> rebelled. His Siſter <hi>Elfleda</hi> had very hard Travel of her firſt Child, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe ever after forbore the Nuptial Embraces, alledging it to be an over-fooliſh Pleaſure which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſuch bitter Pains; and liſting her ſelf a Soldier under her Brother, ſhe performed many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Exploits againſt the <hi>Danes;</hi> againſt whom <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> obtained a great Victory near <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> wherein two of their Kings were ſlain, with many of the Nobility, and a Multitude of Common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which procured him both Fear and Love from the People.</p>
               <p>After his Death <hi>Ethelſtane</hi> reigned, who is ſaid to be the firſt Anointed King of this Iſland: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Dominions farther than he received them. He overthrew <hi>Godfrey</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Howell</hi> King of <hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> forcing them to ſubmit to his Pleaſure; after which he again reſtored them to their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, glorying, <hi>That it was more Honour to make a King, than to be a King.</hi> Theſe Actions procured him much Renown from his Neighbour-Princes, who courted his Friendſhip, and ſent him curious Preſents. <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour, who married his Siſter, ſent him a Curioſity richly ſet with Precious Stones, very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially contrived, wherein were Landskips with Vines, Corn, and Men ſeeming ſo naturally to move, as if they had been real. The King of <hi>Norway</hi> ſent him a ſumptuous Ship, richly gilt, with Purple Sails. The King of <hi>France</hi> ſent him a Sword, which was ſaid to have been <hi>Conſtantine's the Great,</hi> the Hilt whereof was all of Gold, and therein, as they ſaid, was one of the Nails which faſtned Chriſt to the Croſs: He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

The King was much perplexed at theſe Propoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his three valiant Knights, <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> (who lived in his Reign, or not at all) one <hi>Herand</hi> another courageous Knight, and Earl <hi>Rohand, Guy</hi>'s Father-in-Law, were gone to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> In this Strait, after he had prayed for Deliverance, it is ſaid, he had a Viſion, wherein he was directed to riſe early the next Morning, and taking two Biſhops with him, to get up to the top of the North Gate of that City, where he ſhould ſee a likely Man, clothed as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, bare-foot, and on his bare Head a Chaplet of White Roſes, and that this ſhould be the Man that ſhould conquer <hi>Colebrand</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Giant, (for ſo was his Name) and free the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Bondage. The next Day the King thus attended at the Gate, ſees Earl <hi>Guy</hi> ſo habited, being newly arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> whereupon <hi>Athelſtane</hi> addreſſing himſelf to him, deſires him to accept the Combate, as being ordained by Heaven to acquit this Realm from Tyranny. <hi>Guy</hi> replied, <hi>My Lord, you may eaſily perceive that I am not in a Condition to take upon me this Fight, being haraſſed and weakned by daily Travel; lay this Task therefore upon your ſtout and hardy Soldiers, whom you were wont v ry much to eſteem. Ah,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>ſuch indeed I had; but they are gone, ſome to the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>as one valiant Knight, called</hi> Guy, <hi>who was Earl of</hi> Warwick: <hi>I had alſo a courageous Servant, named Sir</hi> Herand de Ardene; <hi>Would to God they were

now here, for then would this Duel be ſoon undertaken, and the War quickly finiſhed.</hi> In ſpeaking which Words the Tears trickled down his Cheeks, which made ſuch impreſſion upon the Pilgrim, that he engaged to undertake the Combate. Upon the Day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Guy</hi> putting on the King's beſt Armour, the Sword of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> St. <hi>Maurice</hi> his Lance, and one of the Kings beſt Courſers, he rode through <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> appearing like a moſt accompliſh'd Knight, and went to the Place appointed, which was in a Valley called <hi>Chiltecumb,</hi> where <hi>Colebrand</hi> ſoon after came, ſo loaded with Armour, that his Horſe could ſcarce bear him, and a Cart driven before him, filled with <hi>Daniſh</hi> Axes, great Clubs with Knobs of Iron, ſquared Bars of Steel, and Iron Hooks to pluck his Adverſary to him. Thus marching diſdainfully along, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> in the height of Pride, he commanded him to come off his Horſe, and throw himſelf with ſubmiſſion at his Feet: But the gallant Pilgrim, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding his Words, commending himſelf to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, put Spurs to his Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at the firſt Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pierced the Giants Shield with ſuch Force, that his Lance broke into Shivers; which ſo enraged the Giant, that coming up furiouſly, he killed <hi>Guy</hi>'s Horſe, who being diſmounted, dangerouſly wounded <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand.</hi> The Combate having laſted for ſome time, the Giant fainted and fell with loſs of Blood, and <hi>Guy</hi> immediately cut off his Head, thereby freeing <hi>England</hi> at preſent from the inſulting <hi>Dane.</hi> After all which, he offered his Sword in the Cathedral of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> which was long after kept in the Veſtry, and called <hi>Colebrand's Ax.</hi> The other Reliques of <hi>Guy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Drayton</hi> thus deſcribes.</p>

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57813:12"/>Thus much for Earl <hi>Guy,</hi> who lived in the Year of Chriſt 929. This King <hi>Ethelſtane,</hi> by the inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his Cup-bearer, became incenſed againſt his Brother, as if he had contrived Treaſon againſt him, who therefore ordered him to be put into a ſmall Veſſel without Tackle or Oars, and ſo be expoſed to the mercy of the Sea; wherewith the young Prince was ſo overwhelm'd with Sorrow, that he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf headlong into the Sea; whoſe Ghoſt the King endeavoured to appeaſe, by a voluntary Penance of ſeven years, and building two Monaſteries. Neither did the treacherous Cup-bearer eſcape Vengeance; for on a Feſtival-day, as he was buſie in waiting, one of his Feet ſlipping, he recovered himſelf by the help of the other, and thereupon pleaſantly ſaid, <hi>You may ſee now how one Brother can help another:</hi> This Speech ſuddenly recalled to the Kings Mind the Death of his Innocent Brother; whereupon he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Cup-bearer, who was the Procurer thereof, to be immediately executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmund,</hi> the fifth Son of King <hi>Edward,</hi> ſucceeded; and after him, <hi>Edred,</hi> his ſixth Son: Then <hi>Edwy,</hi> or <hi>Edwin,</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Edmund</hi> was Crowned at <hi>Kingſton upon Thames,</hi> who was of a laſcivious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for it is related, That on the very Day of his Coronation, he ſuddenly left his Nobility, and went into a private Room, to debauch a great Lady, his near Kinſwoman, whoſe Huſband he ſoon after ſlew. St. <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> who was preſent, and then Abbot of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenbury,</hi> followed the King into his Chamber, and leading him out by the Hand, accuſed him before <hi>Odo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by whom he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reproved, and forbid the Company of that woman. The King was hereat enraged againſt <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> and baniſhed him out of the Land, and became ſo great an Enemy to the Order of Monks, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled many of them out of their Monaſteries, and put married Prieſts in their Places. The People
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57813:13"/>
having a great Opinion of the Holineſs of <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> and being offended at the Kings ſeverity toward him, and other Irregularities, they turned their Affections to <hi>Edgar</hi> his Brother, and removing <hi>Edwin</hi> from his Princely Dignity, <hi>Edgar</hi> was made King in his ſtead; for very grief whereof he ſoon waſted away, and died in 959.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edgar</hi> was called <hi>the Peaceable:</hi> He maintained the Kingdom in great Glory and Proſperity. His Navy Royal is ſaid to conſiſt of three thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships, with which he every Summer ſailed round his Land, to ſecure the Sea from Pyrats. He cauſed <hi>Ludwall</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to pay him three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Wolves yearly, in ſtead of a former Tribute in Money, whereby <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> which were formerly very much over-run, were now ſo freed, that there was ſcarce a Wolf to be found alive. He was very ſevere upon his Judges, if he found them guilty of Bribery and Partiality, riding the Circuit himſelf every Year for that purpoſe: Yet among all theſe Vertues, he is ſaid to be very Voluptuous, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially toward Women, not ſparing the very Nuns; which ſounded ſo ill, that <hi>Dunſtan</hi> took the boldneſs to reprove him for it; and coming into his Preſence, the King in Courteſie roſe from his Royal Throne, to take him by the Hand, and ſeat him by him: But <hi>Dunſtan</hi> refuſing the King his Hand, with a ſtern Countenance and contracted Brow ſpake thus to him. <hi>You that have not been afraid to corrupt a Virgin dedicated to Chriſt, how can you preſume to touch the Conſecrated Hands of a Biſhop? You have defiled the Spouſe of your Maker, and do you now think by your flattering Service to pacifie the Friend of the Bridegroom; No, Sir, do not miſtake your ſelf; for I will be no Friend to him who hath Chriſt for his Enemy.</hi> The King thunder-ſtruck with theſe dreadful Words, and touched with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience, fell down at the Feet of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan;</hi> who raiſing him up, began to aggravate his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57813:13"/>
Crime, and finding the K. pliable to his Inſtruction, he enjoyned him the following Penance for ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>That he ſhould wear no Crown for the ſpace of ſeven years; That he ſhould faſt twice a Week; That he ſhould diſtribute his Treaſure leſt him by his Anceſtors liberally to the Poor, That he ſhould build a Monaſt. for Nuns at</hi> Shaftſbury, <hi>that ſince he had robbed God of one Virgin by his Tranſgreſſion, ſo he ſhould reſtore to him many again for the time to come: Likewiſe, That he ſhould expel Clerks or Prieſts of evil Life</hi> (meaning thoſe who were married) <hi>out of the Churches, and place Monks in their room.</hi> All this <hi>Edgar</hi> performed, and the ſeven years being paſt, <hi>Dunſtan</hi> (ſaith the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian) calling the Nobility, with the Biſhops, Abbots, and Clergy together, he before all the People ſet the Crown upon the Kings Head at <hi>Bath,</hi> in the thirteenth year of his Reign; <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> who it ſeems rul'd all, having hither to hindred it. The Nun here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> a D's.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57813:14"/>
then abuſed, and perſuaded to worſhip for Saints the dead Carcaſes of thoſe that were many times of very profligate Lives while on Earth. In King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Reign there was a great Famine, wherein <hi>Ethelwald</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſold away all the Church-Plate, and Veſſels of Gold and Silver, to relieve the Poor, ſaying, <hi>There was no reaſon that the ſenſeleſs Temples of God ſhould abound in Riches, and the lively Temples of the Holy-Ghoſt to be in want of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Edgar</hi> there was great Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, many of the Nobility being for <hi>Etheldred,</hi> the true and only legitimate Heir of <hi>Edgar;</hi> but the other Nobles, and the Clergy, eſpecially <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> fearing the Married Clergy ſhould again prevail, he, with ſeveral other Biſhops, meeting together, and carrying the Croſs before <hi>Edward,</hi> brought him to the Lords, and by many Perſwaſions prevailed with them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him for their King. He was accounted a juſt, meek Prince, and very charitable to the Poor: Yet enjoyed he the Crown but a ſhort ſpace; for in the fourth Year of his Reign, as he was Hunting near <hi>Corf Caſtle,</hi> where his Brother <hi>Etheldred</hi> and Queen <hi>Elfrida</hi> his Mother reſided, while he was diſcourſing and drinking on Horſeback, as the Cup was at his Mouth, a Servant of the Queens, by her Contrivance, ſtruck him into the Back with a Knife or Dagger; at which ſetting Spurs to his Horſe to get away, and fainting with loſs of Blood, he fell from his Horſe with one Foot in the Stirrup, and was dragged up and down the Woods, till at laſt his Body was left dead at the Gate of <hi>Corf Caſtle.</hi> When this Fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Queen was ſo ſtruck with remorſe, that to expiate her Guilt, ſhe built two Monaſteries <hi>Almſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and <hi>Wormwell:</hi> For, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> obſerves, moſt of theſe Religious Houſes were founded either upon the account of ſome Publick or Private Murther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward the Martyr,</hi> as he was called, being thus

ſlain, <hi>Etheldred</hi> his younger Brother, the Son of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> and Queen <hi>Elfrida,</hi> ſucceeded. He reigned thirty eight Years, but was very unfortunate, and full of Troubles all his time. It is related, That when Archbiſhop <hi>Dunſtan</hi> Chriſtned <hi>Etheldred,</hi> as he held him over the Font, the Child was not very cleanly; whereupon the Biſhop ſwore, <hi>By the Mother of God, this Boy will prove an unhappy and ſlothful Prince;</hi> which hapned accordingly. At his Coronation a Cloud appeared, half like Blood, and the other half like Fire. In his third Year the <hi>Danes</hi> invaded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſeveral Places, and the King paid them Forty thouſand Pound yearly for his Quiet, which much diſobliged his Subjects; yea, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo low, that the <hi>Danes</hi> commanded their Houſes, Wives, Daughters, and all they had: Whereupon <hi>Etheldred</hi> contrived, that all the <hi>Danes</hi> were maſſacred in one Day: But this did more enrage them, ſo that firſt <hi>Swain,</hi> and then <hi>Canutus,</hi> came with two hundred Sail of Ships, and landed in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> burning and deſtroying all before him, and killing Nine hundred Monks and Nuns at one time, the Kings Counſels being all betrayed by the Traytor <hi>Edrick:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fled, with his Queen, <hi>Emma,</hi> and her two Sons, into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to <hi>Richard,</hi> Duke thereof, who was her Brother. But <hi>Swain</hi> being ſoon after killed by his own Men, they made his Son <hi>Canutus</hi> King: After which <hi>Etheldred</hi> returns again to <hi>England,</hi> and perceiving the ſeveral Treaſons againſt him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to withſtand their Fury, he ſoon after died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmund,</hi> the eldeſt Son alive of <hi>Etheldred,</hi> ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſirnamed <hi>Ironſide,</hi> from his great Strength and Courage. He was Crowned at <hi>Kingſton:</hi> But the <hi>Danes</hi> were then ſo powerful in <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Canutus</hi> was accepted King at <hi>Southampton,</hi> many of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Laity ſwearing Allegiance to him; but the City of <hi>London</hi> ſtood firm for <hi>Edmund,</hi> who fought

At length, to avoid further Bloodſhed, they made an Agreement to divide the Kingdom betwixt them; but <hi>Edmund</hi> enjoyed the Benefit of this Accord a very ſhort time, being ſoon after murdered as he was eaſing Nature, by <hi>Edrick,</hi> and his Head preſented to <hi>Canutus,</hi> who, though he loved the Treaſon, yet commanded the Traytor to be beheaded.</p>

                  <hi>Edward</hi> himſelf confeſſed upon his Death bed, That openly ſhe was his Wife, but in ſecret Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings as his own Siſter: But whether it were Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or Chaſtity, it ſeems he was willing to have her accuſed of Incontinency, whereof if ſhe were guilty, he could not be innocent, it being a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to put his Wives Virtue to ſo Tyrannical a trial. After this, ſome Differences aroſe between him and Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and Forces were raiſed on both ſides, but by the Interceſſion of the Nobility, an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made: Yet <hi>Godwin</hi> eſcaped not Divine Vengeance; for being charged by the King for the Murder of <hi>Alfred,</hi> he wiſhed if he were guilty he might never ſwallow down a bit of Bread again; which hapned accordingly: for the firſt bit of Bread he put into his Mouth choaked him, as he ſate with the King at Table: A dreadful Inſtance of Gods Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt Perjury. This King is blamed for his Cruelty to his Mother, in forcing her to paſs over nine burning Plow-ſhares, bare-foot and blind fold, for a Trial of her Continency; which yet ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the leaſt damage. He is ſaid to be the firſt King that cured the Diſeaſe called the <hi>Kings-Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is related, That this King lying on his Bed one Afternoon, with the Curtains drawn, a pilfering Courtier coming into his Chamber, and finding the Kings Casket open, which <hi>Hugoline</hi> his Chamberlain had forgot to ſhut, he took out as much Money as he could well carry, and went away: But finding ſuch Succeſs, he came a ſecond, and a third time, ſtill carrying off more.

               <p>When this King <hi>Edward</hi> was haſtning out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> with a great Army, to recover <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Danes,</hi> being ready to give Battel, his Captains aſſured him of Victory, and that they would not leave one <hi>Dane</hi> alive: <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaid <hi>Edward, that the Kingdom ſhould be recovered for me, who am but one Man, by the death of ſo many thouſands; better it is that I ſhould live a private and unbloody Life, than to be a King by ſuch a Slaughter and Butchery.</hi> This King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Iſſue of his own, ſent for <hi>Edward</hi> the Son of <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who for his long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was called <hi>the Outlaw;</hi> but he dying ſoon after, he declared <hi>Edgar,</hi> the <hi>Outlaw</hi>'s Son, to be Heir, and ſirnamed him <hi>Atheling,</hi> or <hi>Adeling,</hi> a Term appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Preſumptive Heirs of the Crown.

               </p>
               <p>When King <hi>Edward</hi> was on his Death-bed, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved all preſent weeping and lamenting for him, to whom he ſaid, <hi>If you loved me, you would forbear weeping, and rejoyce; becauſe I go to my Father, with whom I ſhall receive the Joys promiſed to the Faithful, not through my Merits but by the free Mercy of my Saviour, who ſheweth Mercy on whom he pleaſeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Death of Earl <hi>Godwin, Harold</hi> his Son grew into great Favour with King <hi>Edward,</hi> and was by him made Lieutenant of his Army againſt the <hi>Welch;</hi> who, with his Brother <hi>Toſto,</hi> or <hi>Toſton,</hi> utterly ſubdued that Rebellion: After which <hi>Harold</hi> ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing

more in favour with the King, there grew ſuch Hatred between the two Brethren, that <hi>Toſto</hi> coming to <hi>Hereford,</hi> ſlew all his Brothers Servants, and cutting them in pieces, ſalted them, and put them into Powdering-tubs. It hapned afterward, that <hi>Harold</hi> going beyond Sea, was by Tempeſt dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and being ſeiſed, and carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Duke <hi>William,</hi> he made him promiſe, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of King <hi>Edward</hi> he would ſecure the Kingdom for him, according to King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Will: Which Oath having taken, <hi>Harold</hi> came back, and told King <hi>Edward</hi> what he had done, who ſeemed well content therewith, ſaith the Hiſtorian; which, if it were true, he had ſurely forgot his former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration concerning <hi>Edgar Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>However, after the Death of King <hi>Edward, Harold</hi> neither regarding his Oath to Duke <hi>William,</hi> nor <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Right, whom he deſpiſed for his tender Age, cauſed himſelf to be Proclaimed King, without any great Ceremony or Celebration, none much appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or diſapproving thereof: And to ingratiate himſelf with the People, he eaſed them of ſeveral ſevere Taxes laid upon them by his Predeceſſor, and was affable and kind to all: But this was a ſhort Calm before a great Storm; for ſoon after Duke <hi>William</hi> ſent his Ambaſſadors to him, to mind him of his Oath; but he returned anſwer, <hi>That it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from him in his Impriſonment, and therefore was no way obliging.</hi> At this Anſwer the Duke was much inraged, and prepared Forces for gaining the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Force: Neither was <hi>Harold</hi> idle, but made Proviſion to withſtand him: At which time a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Comet appeared in the Heavens, which was then judged, and after proved to be a fatal Omen.</p>
               <p>During theſe Preparations, <hi>Toſto</hi> Brother to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> and <hi>Harfager</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships, invaded the Country, landing in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Harfager</hi> claiming the Crown as Son of <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57813:19"/>
but the Nobility of thoſe Parts oppoſing them, were routed: which <hi>Harold</hi> hearing, marched againſt them, and at <hi>Stamford</hi>-Bridge he encountred them, where his whole Army was withſtood by one ſingle <hi>Dane,</hi> who ſlew forty of his Men, and made good the Bridge, till a Soldier in a Boat rowing under the Bridge, thruſt his Spear through a Crevice, and ſo ſlew this valiant Champion: After which, the King fell upon the <hi>D nes,</hi> and got an intire Victory over them, killing King <hi>Harfager,</hi> and <hi>Toſto</hi> his own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Olave</hi> the Son of <hi>Harfager,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> were taken Priſoners, with abundance more, who begging their Lives, the King ordered Twenty of their Three hundred Ships to carry them to <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> with ſad News of the loſs of their King and his whole Army.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this Storm over, but a worſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; for Duke <hi>William</hi> having prepared a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Navy, reſolved for <hi>England,</hi> having the free Conſent of his Nobility for his Voyage, many of them aſſiſting him therein. But firſt he ſent to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> to confirm his Title to the Crown, who did it readily, and withal ſent him a Conſecrated Banner, an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and a Hair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with a Curſe to all Oppoſers, to carry in the Ship wherein he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſailed. Being thorowly furniſhed, he and his Men embarqued at St. <hi>Vallery,</hi> where they ſtaid a long time for a Wind; at length ſetting Sail, <hi>Sept.</hi> 28. 1066. he arrived with his Fleet at <hi>Pevenſey</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where as ſoon as he landed, it hapned one of his Feet ſtuck ſo faſt in the Sand, that he fell to the Ground; whereupon one of his Attendants catching him by the Arm, and helping him up, ſaid, <hi>Stand up, my Lord, and be of good Courage, for now you have taken faſt Footing in</hi> England; and obſerving that he had taken up Sand and Earth in his Hand, he added, <hi>You have now taken Livery and Seiſin of the Country;</hi> it being the Cuſtom, that when Poſſeſſion is taken of Land, a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57813:19"/>
piece of Earth is given to the Poſſeſſor. A Wizard or Necromancer had told Duke <hi>William,</hi> That he ſhould ſafely arrive in <hi>England</hi> with his whole Army, without any hindrance from <hi>Harold;</hi> which, after it came to paſs, King <hi>William</hi> ſent for this Conjurer, to confer further with him; but it was told him, That he was drowned in that Ship which alone of the whole Navy miſcarried; whereupon the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſaid, <hi>He would never put confidence in that Science which was of more benefit to the Ignorant than the Skilful therein; for it ſeems he could foreſee my good Fortune, but not his own Misfortune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his Landing, the Duke ſet all his Ships on fire, to aſſure his Men that they muſt either conquer or die. He then marched toward <hi>Haſtings,</hi> declaring the Cauſe of his coming to be to inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was given him by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſtrictly charging his Soldiers not to wrong any of the People in the leaſt ſince they were ſo ſoon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Natural Subjects. He then ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Harold,</hi> either to deliver him up the Country, and be ſubject to him, or to fight it out in the ſight of both Armies in ſingle Combate; or laſtly, to ſtand to the Pope's Determination: But he returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That unleſs he did ſuddenly depart, he would give him cauſe to repent this his raſh Invaſion; and that the next day it ſhould be tried by more Swords than One.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>Harold</hi> marcheth couragiouſly againſt Duke <hi>William,</hi> who put himſelf into a poſture to receive him. It hapned, that the Morning before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, <hi>William</hi>'s Armourer, by miſtake, put on his Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece before, and his Breaſt-plate behind; which being obſerved by ſome of his Attendants, was judged an ill Omen, and therefore they adviſed him not to fight that Day: To whom the Duke replied, <hi>I value not ſuch Fooleries; but if I have any skill in Soothſaying, (as in truth I have none) I am of the opinion it doth fore ell, that I ſhall change my Condition, and of a Duke ſhall this day become a King.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57813:20"/>The Armies being Marſhalled, <hi>Harold</hi> placing the <hi>Kentiſh-men</hi> with their heavy Axes or Halberts in the Van, the Battel began, both Parties fighting bravely, one for the Liberty of their Country, and the other for a Kingdom. The <hi>Normans</hi> perceiving they could not break the united Strength of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fly, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> believing, purſued them in diſorder; whereupon the <hi>Normans</hi> taking the advantage, rallied, and charging them furiouſly in that disjoynted Poſture, made a very great Slaughter among the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and, among the reſt, King <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> his Brother, and moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, fell that day; and of the Common Soldiers, Sixty ſeven thouſand nine hundred ſeventy four: Others report, an hundred thouſand were ſlain. Duke <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> had three Horſes killed under him, yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the leaſt Wound, his Loſs being onely, as is ſaid, Six thouſand Men. Thus died King <hi>Harold,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely nine Months Reign, and was buried at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> Abby in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> And it is very remarkable, That whereas <hi>Harold,</hi> with his Father <hi>Godwin,</hi> had cruelly murdered <hi>Alfred</hi> the true Heir to the Crown, and his <hi>Normans,</hi> he was now by a <hi>Norman</hi> wounded in the left Eye with an Arrow, whereof he immediately died.

               <p>DUke <hi>William</hi> after the Fight (which from that time was called <hi>Battel-Field,</hi> and an Abby of that name built there) haſtned toward <hi>London,</hi> waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Counties of <hi>Kent, Suſſex, Surrey, Hantſhire</hi> and <hi>Berkshire;</hi> and croſſing the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> marched through <hi>Oxfordſhire, Bucks,</hi> and <hi>Hartford hire,</hi> and on <hi>Chriſtmas day</hi> following was Crowned King at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by the inforced Conſent of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, who with outward Applauſe, though with inward Grief and Diſcontent, acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be his Subjects, the <hi>Kentiſh-men</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, by whom, as he went to poſſeſs himſelf of the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Dover,</hi> he was intercepted in his March, being encompaſſed by many valiant Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who carrying green Boughs in their Hands, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a moving Wood, ſuddenly environed him and his Followers, proteſting, <hi>That rather than they would baſely loſe their Privileges, and be deprived of their ancient Laws and Cuſtoms, they were reſolved every Man to die in the Place.</hi> The King conſidering his own Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and their Reſolution conſented to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and for their bold and generous Reſolution, he ever after honoured them with this Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, <hi>That the Men of</hi> Kent <hi>ſhould lead the Van in the Field:</hi> And thereupon the Earldom and Caſtle of <hi>Dover</hi> was delivered to King <hi>William</hi> Now what the <hi>Kentiſh-men</hi> obtained by Arms, the Citizens of <hi>London</hi>

procured by Art; for one <hi>William</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> being their Biſhop, they ſo prevailed with him, and he with the King, that he confirmed their former Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, written in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, and ſealed with Green Wax, to this Effect.</p>
               <p>William <hi>King greeteth</hi> William <hi>Biſhop, and</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey <hi>Portreeve, and all the Burgeſſes that in</hi> London <hi>be,</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Engliſh, <hi>Friendly: And I do you to wit, That I will that you enjoy all the Law which you did in the Days of</hi> Edward <hi>King.

               </p>
               <p>King <hi>William</hi> having thus conquered the Kingdom, uſed ſeveral Policies for ſecuring it to himſelf: For, preſuming that he was obeyed by the Natives more out of Fear than Love, 1. He took Hoſtages of thoſe that were deareſt to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> either Sons or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, whom he ſent into <hi>Normandy,</hi> for ſecuring their Fidelity. 2. He deprived the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all Offices both of Honour and Profit, conferring them on his <hi>Normans.</hi> 3 Becauſe the Clergy were much reverenced by the People, and concerned themſelves in Temporal Affairs, he ordained, That they ſhould concern themſelves onely in Spiritual Matters. 4. To take away all Hopes of regaining their Liberty, he diſarmed all the Natives, and left them utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to make any Reſiſtance. 5. To prevent all Concourſe or Meetings where they might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to condole their Miſeries, eſpecially in the Night, he commanded a Bell to be hung up in every Town, Village, and City, to be rung at Eight a Clock every Night, at which every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> was to put out his Fire, and to keep himſelf within his Houſe. 6. To diminiſh the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, he ſent them to fight his Battels in <hi>Normandy;</hi> and if any of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Victorious, they were much diſcountenanced, in ſtead of being rewarded: The Common People
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57813:22"/>
were likewiſe uſed in the ſame manner, being ſtill ordered to endure the hotteſt Service in Fight, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Normandy.</hi> 7. He erected ſtrong Forts and Caſtles in ſeveral places of the Realm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his Countrymen, who made the leaſt Crime committed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be Capital to them. 8. He deprived the Gentry and Clergy of their Plate and Money, yea even that uſed in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, alledging, That Thieves, Traytors, and Rebels had hid them there, to deceive him of his Forfeitures, and ſupport themſelves againſt his Authority. 9. He publiſhed divers ſevere Laws in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, whereby many <hi>Engliſh</hi> of great Eſtates did ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſgreſs, and the ſmalleſt Offences were made ſufficient to ſeiſe their Eſtates, which were violently taken from them, without any Commiſeration. 10. He declared the Patents, Grants, and Charters of former Kings to be void, and having ſeiſed them into his own Hands, he ſold them again to the true Owners for great Sums of Money; which if they could not procure, he gave them to his <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi> 11. He took a general Survey of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Lands and Cattel, and then laid unreaſonable Taxes upon them, not regarding their Cries or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. 12. He erected new Courts of Juſtice for adminiſtring his new Laws, and cauſed his Judges conſtantly to follow his Court, that they might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver act any thing which ſhould diſpleaſe him, or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> 13. To give the freer Acceſs to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould rebell, he plucked down and ruined Thirty ſix Churches, with many Towns and Villages, for many Miles, even from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to the Sea, making his New Foreſt there: But this Offence did not eſcape unpuniſhed; for in this very Foreſt, <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings ſecond Son was goared by a Deer, and died; <hi>William Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi> his third Son, was ſlain by an Arrow ſhot at an Hart; and his Grandchild, <hi>Robert Curtoyſe,</hi> being in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57813:22"/>
purſuit of the Game, was ſtruck by a Bough into the Jaws, and died there. 14. His chief Pleaſure being in Hunting, he ſeiſed all Chaſes and Foreſts of the Kingdom into his Hands, making very cruel Laws againſt ſuch as preſumed to hunt in them without Licenſe, as the loſs of Eyes, Limbs, and the like. 15. He gave large Territories and Farms to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, who leaſed them out to their Slaves and Servants, creating them into Mannors, and calling themſelves Lords thereof. He reſerved ſome Tenures to himſelf, whereby his Tenants were obliged to ſerve him in the Wars, or attend his Perſon, to which they were ſworn in Publick Courts; by which Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure he diſpoſed of their Heirs in Marriage, having Poſſeſſion of their Eſtates till they were Twenty one years of age: By which Example, other Great Lords did the like.</p>
               <p>This was the Model of King <hi>William</hi>'s ſharp and ſevere Government, wherein he rather uſed the Power of an inſolent and lawleſs Conquerour, than the Legal Adminiſtration of a gracious King; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was feared by many, but loved by few; and ſuch as were moſt in favour with him, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced upon every ſlight occaſion. Theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Proceedings, eſpecially in raiſing ſuch intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Taxes, occaſioned a Rebellion in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and another in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the ſecond Year of his Reign; but his good Fortune ſoon ſuppreſſed them, as it alſo did the next Year the Invaſion of <hi>Swanus</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was incited thereto by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that fled thither for Succour from the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of King <hi>William;</hi> but he no ſooner ſaw them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, e're he made them fly back to their Ships; and to revenge the Infidelity of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed their fruitful Lands about <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> ſo that the Ground lay waſte nine years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and abundance of People died with Want and Famine. The next year he ſummoned a general
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57813:23"/>
Convocation of the Clergy, wherein he bitterly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed ſeveral grave and learned Biſhops, Abbots Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and others, of many pretended Crimes and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, for which he abſolutely deprived them of their Dignities and Eſtates, which he beſtowed on others, either for Love or Money.</p>
               <p>Theſe inſufferable Acts provoked <hi>Marcarus</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Mercia,</hi> with <hi>Egilwyn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> to raiſe an Inſurrection: But the King quickly drove <hi>Edwyn</hi> into <hi>Scotland: Marcarus</hi> was taken and impriſoned in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he long continued; and the Biſhop was inhumanely famiſh'd to death in <hi>Abington</hi> Abby. At this time great difference aroſe about the Primacy of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> but at laſt it was adjudged in favour of the firſt, and <hi>York</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted accordingly. In his fifteenth year, his eldeſt Son <hi>Robert,</hi> by the inſtigation of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, rebelled againſt him in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned his Father to go thither with an Army, where he was ſo ſtoutly encountred, that he was unhorſed, and in great danger of his Life, by his Son, unknown; but he hearing his Fathers Voice, reſcued him again, and was after reconciled, and received Pardon of his Father; and the King with great loſs returned again to <hi>England.</hi> Soon after <hi>William,</hi> to revenge divers Injuries and Affronts offered him by King <hi>Phi ip</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> went with a gallant Army into <hi>France;</hi> where finding <hi>Odo</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> his Brother by the Mother, to hold ſecret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the <hi>French</hi> King, he complained thereof to the Lords; whereupon <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> adviſed the King to commit him to Priſon: <hi>What,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>are you for committing a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? You need not,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lanfrank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commit the Biſhop of</hi> Bayeux, <hi>but you may very juſtly impriſon the Earl of</hi> Kent: Which was done accordingly. Sometime before this, Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> dying, a Magician told <hi>Odo,</hi> That he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57813:23"/>
foreſaw he ſhould ſucceed him; upon which <hi>Odo,</hi> having already ſwallowed the Papacy in thought, ſent Money (the moſt prevailing Meſſenger) to <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, and purchaſed himſelf a Palace there, providing likewiſe for his Journey thither; but King <hi>William,</hi> for his Preſumption, and other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, ſtaid and committed him, ſaying, <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive foolhardineſs muſt be reſtrained in time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While the King was in <hi>Normandy</hi> he fell ſick, and the <hi>French</hi> King hearing his Diſtemper was in his Belly, ſcoffingly ſaid, <hi>Our Couſin</hi> William <hi>is now in Childbed; Ah, what a number of Candles muſt I offer at his going to Church? Sure an hundred thouſand will hardly be enough.</hi> King <hi>William</hi> hearing of this Jeſt, ſaid, <hi>Well, I hope our Couſin of</hi> France <hi>ſhall be at no ſuch Coſt; for after this my Childbirth, at my going to Church, I will</hi> (ſaith he, ſwearing by the Reſurrection and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God) <hi>find him a thouſand Candles, and light them all my ſelf:</hi> Alluding to the Candles that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſed to carry in that Age, when they went to be Churched. And ſoon after he performed his Word, deſtroying the People, Towns, and Cities on the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> with Sword and Fire; but in burning the City of <hi>Mantz</hi> he came ſo near the flames, that with the heat of his Harneſs he got a Sickneſs, which being increaſed by the Leaping of his Horſe, burſt the inner Rim of his Belly, he being very Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent; of which he ſoon after died at <hi>Roan.</hi> Upon his Death-bed he ſaid, <hi>I appoint no Succeſſor to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> England, <hi>but I commend it to the Eternal God, whoſe I am, and in whoſe Hands all things are.</hi> He much lamented his Severity and Cruelty to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation. He was buried in the Abby of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> at <hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> though his Funerals were interrupted by a <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman, who would not permit him to be buried, till he had received Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for that Ground, which the Conquerour had unjuſtly taken from him. Thus this victorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57813:24"/>
whoſe Mind could not be confin'd to one Kingdom while he lived, being dead, could hardly get a place to be buried in. The Charters and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances in his Reign were not ſo tedious as now adays, but very ſhort and plain, as appears by this following, tranſcribed out of an Authentick Record.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> William <hi>King, the third of my Reign, give to</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hunter, <hi>to me that art both leif and dear, the Hop, and the Hopton, and all the Bounds up and down, under the Earth to Hell, above the Earth to Heaven, from me and mine, to thee and thine, as good and as fair, as ever they mine were. To witneſs that this is ſooth, I bite the white Wax with my Tooth: Before</hi> Jug, Maud, <hi>and</hi> Margery, <hi>and my youngeſt Son</hi> Henry; <hi>For a Bow and a broad Arrow, when I come to hunt upon</hi> Yarrow.

In this Kings Reign lived <hi>Bevois,</hi> or <hi>Bevis,</hi> Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> who not being able to endure the Oppreſſion of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> gathered all the ſcattered Fragments of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> whom deſire of Liberty, and hatred of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, had made willing to joyn with him; aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating to him likewiſe the Strength of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Welch,</hi> who met at <hi>Cardiff</hi> in <hi>Wales:</hi> But Succeſs not depending upon Valour, being unable to encounter ſuch expert Soldiers as the <hi>Normans,</hi> their Forces were routed, and <hi>Bevis</hi> fled to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> after which no credible Author relates what became of him: Tho' the Monkiſh Writers have been very injurious to his Memory, as well as of others, who by repeating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible things concerning them, have made Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity think there was no Truth in any of their Actions. His Place of Reſidence is ſaid to be <hi>Dunton</hi> in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> and his Sword was till of late kept as a Relique in <hi>Arundel</hi>-Caſtle, not equalling in length that of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>

He was diſcreet and Politick in managing his Affairs and Buſineſs; yet it ſeems he perceived his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in ſome Caſes, for want of Learning; and did therefore often excite his Sons to learn, with this Saying, <hi>That an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned Prince is but a crowned Aſs:</hi> Which Speech made ſuch a ſtrong Impreſſion upon his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> that by his Knowledge and Learning he obtained the Name of <hi>Beauclark,</hi> or Fine Scholar.

               </p>
               <p>King <hi>William</hi> having now more ſurely fixed himſelf in his Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, began preſently to follow his Fathers Example, endeavouring to humble the innate Courage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by heavy Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Impoſitions, and taking it for a Maxim, <hi>That Riches heightned, but Poverty debaſed the Spirits of Men;</hi> he laid ſevere Taxes upon the People, which were levied with all kind of deſpite and cruelty by his ravenous Officers. This cauſed much diſcontent, of which <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> taking the advantage, and being affronted at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, he invaded the North Parts with a great Army, killing, burning, and deſtroying all before him, till at laſt he ſate down before a ſtrong Caſtle in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly defended by <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> the Earl thereof, who at laſt pretending to ſurrender it, and coming out of his Caſtle-gate well mounted, with the Keys thereof faſtned to his Lance, in ſtead of delivering them, in making low Obeiſance to the King in token of Submiſſion, clapping Spurs to his Horſe, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ran upon the King, and with his Lance pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him into the Eye, whereof he immediately died: After which, by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe he made his Eſcape, leaving the amazed <hi>Scots</hi> to lament their irreparable Loſs, who returned back to <hi>Scotland</hi> with their breath'eſs King.</p>

By St.</hi> Luke<hi>'s Face,</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>thou art a brave Fellow, and ſhalt be inrolled my Knight, with a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuitable to thy great Valour.</hi> The Siege continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, <hi>Henry</hi> was much diſtreſſed for Water, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Favour of <hi>Robert</hi> not to deny him what Heaven had made common to all: Upon which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> ordered him to be ſupplied; whereat <hi>William</hi> being inraged, <hi>What,</hi> ſays <hi>Robert, doſt thou more value a little Water, which is to be found every where, than the Life of a Brother, having onely my ſelf and him?</hi> In a ſhort time Peace was made, and all the Brethren were reconciled: After which, Duke <hi>Robert</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> accompanied with ſeveral other Chriſtian Princes, he mortgaged his Dukedom to the King for Six thouſand ſix hundred ſixty ſix Pound; to raiſe which Sum, King <hi>William</hi> laid heavy Taxes upon his Subjects; neither were Churches and Monaſteries Privileges, he forcing the Clergy to bring in vaſt Sums.</p>

marched againſt them could not prevail to ſuppreſs them. At the ſame time <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> E. of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> judging himſelf not ſufficiently rewarded for his Service againſt <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> raiſed a Rebellion; againſt whom <hi>William</hi> marched with great fury, and as ſoon as he met with his revolted Subjects, he quickly put them to flight; and for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to others, he cut off the Ears, Hands, Noſes, Feet, of ſeveral of the Priſoners, putting out the Eyes of others; and <hi>Mowbray</hi> being taken was ſent Priſoner to <hi>Windſor</hi>-Caſtle.</p>
               <p>King <hi>William</hi> ſtill continued his Exactions upon the People, ſelling all Offices in Church and State for ready Money, and keeping many Biſhopricks and Abbies vacant a long time, that he might receive the Revenues thereof, ſaying, <hi>That Chriſt's Bread</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church-Lands) <hi>is ſweet, dainty, and moſt delicate Food for Kings.</hi> Theſe things were ſharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>Anſelm</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Redreſs, he appealed to Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Third, which the King prohibited him to do: <hi>The Cuſtom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from my Fathers time hath been, That no Perſon in</hi> England <hi>ſhould appeal to the Pope, without the King's Licenſe: He that violateth the Cuſtoms of the Realm, violateth the Crown and Power of the Kingdom; and he that violateth and taketh away the Crown, is a Traytor and an Enemy againſt me.</hi> Yet the Biſhop, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of Conſcience, and Obedience to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Succeſſors in Spiritual Matters, was reſolved to go, and went accordingly, though the King would not ſuffer him to carry any thing with him, ordering all his Goods to be ſeiſed as he was travelling to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque himſelf.</p>
               <p>King <hi>William,</hi> while he was at Dinner in <hi>New-Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi> had Advice ſent him, That the <hi>French</hi> King had beſieged the City of <hi>Conſtantia</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that it was in great danger to be loſt: Whereupon he ſwore (his uſual Oath) by St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Face, <hi>That he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57813:27"/>
would not turn his Back till he had relieved them;</hi> and thereupon commanded the Wall of the Houſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to be pulled down, and leaving his Sports, bidding his Nobles follow him, he poſted with great expedition to the Sea, without any Preparations for ſuch a Voyage; and finding a Ship, it hapned to be a very great Tempeſt; yet he commanded the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to ſet Sail immediately, which they diſſuaded him from, as a thing extremely deſperate; but the King replied, <hi>Hoiſe up your Sails in God's Name, for I never yet heard of a King that was drowned in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt; you ſhall ſee, both the Winds and Waves will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to us:</hi> Which hapned accordingly; and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving unexpectedly, the <hi>French</hi> were ſo extremely ſurpriſed, that they preſently raiſed the Siege, and departed. Such was the Courage and Reſolution of this fortunate Prince; which further appears by this Inſtance: Being ſuddenly ſet upon by three armed Soldiers, who had juſt before unhorſed him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf with his Saddle, in ſtead of a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, in one Hand, and his Sword in the other, till his own Men came to his Relief, who blamed him for taking too much care to ſave his Saddle: <hi>By St.</hi> Luke, ſaid he, <hi>I had rather have loſt my Life, than left my Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to the ſcorn of the Enemy.</hi> Another Inſtance is, That in the late Surpriſe of the <hi>French</hi> before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans,</hi> he took <hi>Helias</hi> Earl of <hi>Fleſcia</hi> their Commander in Chief Priſoner, who when he ſaw himſelf capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, imputed this his Misfortune to the unlooked-for Arrival of the King, threatning great matters if he were again at liberty: Whereupon the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be immediately ſet at liberty, and bid him do the utmoſt he was able.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond year of his Reign a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake hapned; and in his fourth year, a very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lightning, which left an intolerable Stink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and burnt the Steeple of the Abby of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> rending the Rafters on the Roof, and throwing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57813:28"/>
down the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and a Crucifix, breaking one of the Legs thereof. In his thirteenth year ſeveral other Prodigies hapned, which were judged Forerunners of his Death. In the Morning before he was ſlain, he told his Attendants, That he dreamed the laſt Night, an extreme cold Wind paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed thorow his Sides. Whereupon ſome perſwaded him not to hunt that day; but he reſolving on the contrary, anſwered, <hi>They are no good Chriſtians that regard Dreams.</hi> That very day, while he was hunting in <hi>New-Foreſt</hi> afore-mentioned, he was ſlain with an Arrow, which being ſhot at a Deer, unfortunately glanced upon him, and ſtruck him dead.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the Troubleſom though Victorious Reign of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> ſo called from his ruddy Complexion. He was the third Son of <hi>William the Conquerour.</hi> He was of a wanton diſpoſition, very much delighting himſelf among his Concubines, and died without any Legitimate Iſſue. He was comely, ſtrong, active, and healthy of Body, of an high Courage and Conſtancy, not ſhaken with any Frowns of Fortune; and withal very covetous: ſo that what with the Peſtilence, and his great Exactions, the Ground lay untilled, from whence proceeded great Famine and Scarcity thorow <hi>England.</hi> Thus he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and after he had reigned Thirteen years and ten months, thus he died, in 1100. getting much, and ſuddenly leaving all.</p>

               <p>AT the Death of <hi>William Rufus, Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the elder Brother, was fighting victoriouſly (with ſeveral other Chriſtian Princes) againſt the Infidels, in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> being fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in all his Proceedings, ſave onely in his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Crown; for his Succeſs was ſo great there, that he was freely, offered to be made King of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which he as generouſly refuſed. By reaſon of his Abſence, his youngeſt Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> without the leaſt trouble or difficulty, aſcended the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, with the univerſal Approbation of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Commons, whoſe Inclinations were the ſtronger toward him, becauſe he was born in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> after his Father was Crowned King, and from the great Opinion they had of his ſingular Vertues, Learning, and good Temper. Yet before his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Nobles obliged him to ſwear, That he would eaſe the People of the great Taxes, and many other Preſſures under which they ſuffered; which he accordingly performed.</p>
               <p>After he was Crowned, for the better enſuring his Eſtate and Title againſt the Claim of his Brother <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> he freely diſtributed the great Treaſures left by King <hi>William,</hi> among thoſe who upon all Occaſions he judged would ſtand by his Intereſt. He dignified the Wealthy with high Offices and Titles of Honour: He abated the Rigour of the New Laws, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſtitution of their old Privileges: He regulated Weights and Meaſures, bringing them all to one Standard: He freed the People from the heavy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Danegilt,</hi> and from all other unjuſt Taxes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57813:29"/>
and Payments impoſed by the former Kings: He gave liberty to the Nobility and Gentry to encloſe Parks and Chaſes, with Game, for their Recreation: He baniſhed from his Court all Flatterers, as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to his State and Government; and all Luxury, Sumptuouſneſs in Apparel, and Superfluity in Diet, he utterly diſcountenanced: He ordained, That Thieves and High-way Robbers ſhould be puniſhed with Death: With all manner of diligence and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication he endeavoured to reform the monſtrous Pride, intolerable Covetouſneſs, and extreme Sloth and Negligence of the Clergy: He recalled <hi>Anſelm</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> from Baniſhment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him to his Biſhoprick, giving him full Power to call Convocations and Synods at his Pleaſure, for regulating the intolerable Abuſes of the Church; yet leaving to the Pope his Authority to inveſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, by giving them the Ring, the Pall, and the Paſtoral Staff. All ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Dignities and Revenues which his Brother, by the lewd Advice of <hi>Reynulph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> had ſeiſed into his Hands, he freely conferred upon Grave and Learned Perſons, and committed <hi>Reynulph</hi> Priſoner to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> from whence he afterward eſcaped, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly invited Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> who was now returned with great Honour from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> to recover the Kingdom with his Sword; who thereupon raiſed a great Army, with a Deſign to tranſport them to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Henry</hi> having by his Proceedings endeared himſelf to his People, confirmed them now further, by marrying <hi>Maud</hi> Siſter of <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and Daughter of <hi>Malcolm</hi> by <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife, Siſter to <hi>Edgar Atheling,</hi> and Daughter to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> the Son of <hi>Edmund Ironſide,</hi> the victorious and valiant King of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> Soon after Duke <hi>Robert</hi> arrived with his Army at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> many <hi>Engliſh</hi> joyning with him, and great Expectations and Fears

aroſe of a bloody War; but by the diſcreet Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Friends to both Sides, a loving Agreement was concluded, upon almoſt the ſame Conditions as with <hi>William Rufus,</hi> namely, That <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Crown during Life, paying to <hi>Robert</hi> Three thouſand Marks a year: Whereupon <hi>Robert</hi> returned back, to the great diſcontent of his own Nobility. Afterward <hi>Robert</hi> returned again to <hi>England,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his Brothers good Fortune, where he was Royally entertained, and at the Requeſt of his Siſter Queen <hi>Maud,</hi> he forgave the Payment of the Three thouſand Marks a year. Yet after a while the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dominion cauſed <hi>Henry,</hi> upon ſome ſlight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to quarrel with his Brother; which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far, that he went over to <hi>Normandy</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; where being aſſiſted by many of the Duke's diſcontented Nobility and Gentry, he ſo prevailed againſt <hi>Robert,</hi> that he took the Cities of <hi>Roan, Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> returning victoriouſly into <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> perceiving that his Lords and People had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſaken him, and refuſed their Aſſiſtance, and <hi>Henry</hi>'s Strength and Riches increaſing, he came pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately into <hi>England,</hi> and preſented himſelf to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, referring himſelf and all his Concerns to his own Determination: But the King, either knowing the Inconſtancy of the Duke, or being prepoſſeſſed by ſome Whiſperers that he did not intend uprightly, turned from his diſtreſſed Brother with a ſcornful and diſdainful Countenance, refuſing to accept of this his humble Submiſſion. The Duke being ſtruck to the Heart, returns back to his own Country, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to die like a Man in the Field; but <hi>Henry</hi> ſoon routed his weak Forces, and brought him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner into <hi>England,</hi> committing him to <hi>Cardiff</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Wales,</hi> where endeavouring his Liberty, his Eyes by <hi>Henry</hi>'s Command were put out; after which,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57813:30"/>
he lived miſerably Twenty years, and was buried at <hi>Gloceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Robert Belaſme</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> raiſed a Rebellion; but being ſoon vanquiſhed, he fled into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where finding <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> who was offended with the King for keeping from him the Earldom of <hi>Kent,</hi> he ſoon perſwaded him to raiſe another Inſurrection; and joyning their Forces, they deſigned great matters, but were preſently routed by the King's Forces, and kept Priſoners during their Lives.</p>
               <p>The King being now freed from fear of Enemies, reſolved to take the ſame Advantages his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had done, as to the Inveſtiture of Biſhops, and taking vacant Biſhopricks into his Hands; whereat <hi>Anſelm</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed, that he refuſed to Conſecrate ſuch new Biſhops as had received their Inveſtitures from the King: But <hi>Girald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> freely performed it upon the King's Command. Hereupon <hi>Anſelm</hi> went to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain at <hi>Rome,</hi> and prevailed at laſt againſt the King by a Synod of the Clergy held at <hi>London.</hi> Three years after <hi>Anſelm</hi> died, and King <hi>Henry</hi> ſeiſed the Revenues of his Biſhoprick into his Hands, which he kept five years; and if at any time he were intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Biſhops to beſtow it, he ſtill anſwered, <hi>That he onely kept it for an able and ſufficient Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having enjoyed a few years of Peace, he was again rowſed out of it by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, who joyning with <hi>Fulk</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and <hi>Baldwyn</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> they all made great Preparations for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy:</hi> But <hi>Henry</hi> raiſing an Army of valiant Commanders and Soldiers, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, and ſoon engaged with them in Battel, which continued nine hours, with ſo great fury on each ſide, that though King <hi>Henry</hi> won the Field, and chaſed his flying Enemies a long way, yet he would often ſay, <hi>That he then fought not for Victory, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57813:31"/>
Life.</hi> Quickly after a Reconciliation was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe four Princes, and <hi>William,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s eldeſt Son, was married to the Earl of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But in their Voyage hither, the two young Princes, two more of the King's Children, and his Niece <hi>Lucy,</hi> with her Husband the Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> with near one hundred and fourſcore others, were unfortunately drowned by the careleſneſs of the drunken Mariners; at which the King was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſmay'd. The <hi>Welch</hi> ſoon after rebelled, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Power they could make; which yet the King in a little time, and with ſmall Loſs, overthrew, ſuffering his Soldiers to glut their Swords in the Blood of thoſe Rebels, whom neither gentle Uſage, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Severity, could oblige to Loyalty.</p>
               <p>The King returning from <hi>Wales</hi> with Honour, ſoon after ſent his Daughter <hi>Maud</hi> to be married to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> her contracted Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, with a Princely Portion of Silver and Gold. At the ſame time he erected the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, appointing it to conſiſt of Three Eſtates, of which himſelf was the Head; ſo that the Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by the Conſent of all, ſhould not be diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of any. In his Twenty ſeventh year <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor died without any Iſſue by <hi>Maud,</hi> who being at that time Twenty four years old, was courted by the greateſt Princes in the Chriſtian World: But the King, to ſtrengthen his Kingdom againſt the <hi>French,</hi> married her to <hi>Jeffry Plantaginet,</hi> Son and Heir to <hi>Fulk</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> by whom ſhe had three Sons, <hi>Henry,</hi> (who was King after <hi>Stephen) Jeffry,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> which gave much content to the King, to think that his Race ſhould ſucceed in the Crown; and the more to ſecure it, he obliged his Nobility, and the Great Officers of the Kingdom, to take no leſs than three ſolemn Oaths in five years time, That with their beſt Advice, and the hazard of their Lives and Eſtates, they would ſupport and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57813:31"/>
the Succeſſion of his Daughter, and her Heirs.</p>
               <p>It was a Cuſtom in his time, that all Bills and Orders which concerned the Servitors of the Court ſhould be ſigned without a Fee: Now it hapned that <hi>Thurſtan</hi> the Steward complained to the King againſt <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Clerk of the Signet, for refuſing to ſign a Bill without a Fee. The King heard <hi>Thurſtan</hi> firſt, commending that old Cuſtom, and reproving the Clerk for Exaction. The Clerk anſwered, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Bill, and deſired your Steward onely to beſtow on me two Spiced Cakes, made for your own Mouth; which he refuſing, I denied to ſign his Bill.</hi> The King then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Steward, commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to ſit down on the Bench, and then ordered the Steward to put off his Cloke, and to fetch in a clean Napkin two of the beſt Spiced Cakes for the King's Mouth, and humbly to preſent them to <hi>Adam;</hi> which being done, <hi>Adam</hi> ſigned the Bill, and the King made them Friends, adding, <hi>That Officers of the Court ought to be kind to Strangers, if they wanted their Aſſiſtance; and much more to gratifie one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Maud</hi> his Wife was ſo devout, that ſhe would go to Church bare-foot, and was ſtill employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Works of Charity; inſomuch that <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> her Brother coming to viſit her, found her in her Privy Chamber, with a Towel about her Middle, waſhing, wiping, and kiſſing Poor Mens Feet: which he diſliking, ſaid, <hi>Sure if your Husband knew this, you ſhould never kiſs his Lips.</hi> She replied, <hi>That the Feet of the King of Heaven were to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lips of any King on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> had a Pottle of Wine every Night ſet in his Chamber; but becauſe he ſeldom uſed to drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Chamberlain and Pages were wont to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſe it among them. One time about Midnight the King called for Wine, whereat the Chamberlain and Pages were much troubled, becauſe they had left none: At length <hi>Pain</hi> being called in, humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57813:32"/>
the matter, begging pardon. <hi>What,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>have you but one Pottle a Night? That is too little for me and you; For the future I will allow two; one for my ſelf, and another for you and your Fellows.</hi> For this Act the King was commended for Bounty and Clemency.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> had reigned Thirty five years and four Months, he ſurfeited by eating of Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preys, and died in the Sixty fifth year of his Age, 1135. and was buried at <hi>Reading</hi> in <hi>Berkshire.</hi> He was Wiſe, Learned, and Valiant; yet more inclined to Peace than War. He never levied but two Taxes on his People, one for his Wars in <hi>France,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for marrying his Daughter <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs. He grew rich of his own, and was liberal. He made good Laws, which were profitable to the Virtuous, but ſharp againſt Malefactors, uſing more Severity than Mercy; from whence he was accounted cruel by the Common People, but ſtyled the <hi>Lion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> by the Learned. He was gentle and grateful to his Friends, rough to his Enemies, but eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: Yet was he too laſcivious in his Life, having many Concubines, by whom he had twelve Baſtards, whom he owned. He left no Legitimate Sons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and therefore in this King ended the Iſſue-Male of <hi>William the Conquerour,</hi> and the Crown was devolved to his general Heirs.</p>

               <p>THe Experience of all Ages doth inform us, That for the eager deſire of Honour and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Men have broken all Bonds of Honeſty and Friendſhip; but if a Kingdom may be obtained, though with the breach of the moſt ſolemn Oaths and Obligations, there is no ſcruple made of it, and Men will venture upon Perjury and Damnation for gaining thereof; which was too truly verified at this time: For though <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> by <hi>Adela</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi>'s Daughter, was a Perſon whom King <hi>Henry</hi> had chiefly obliged by many Solemn and Publick Oaths, to further the Succeſſion of his Daughter <hi>Maud</hi> and her Children, yet after his Death, finding that all the Nobility, who were equally ſworn as himſelf, applied themſelves to him, and awaited his Commands, he either forgot or diſregarded all his former Vows, and cauſed himſelf to be Crowned King, partly by the procurement of his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> but chiefly by means of <hi>Hugh Bigot,</hi> who took his Oath that King <hi>Henry</hi> upon his Death-bed appointed <hi>Stephen</hi> to be his Succeſſor, having diſinherited his Daughter <hi>Maud</hi> upon ſome diſguſt taken againſt her; the Prelates ſwearing to obey him as their King, ſo long as he did preſerve the Privileges of the Church; and the Nobles ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Allegiance to him, ſo long as he kept his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with them, and preſerved their Rights; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he acknowledged his Right to the Crown to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from their Election.</p>
               <p>To confirm himſelf in his Dignity, he proceeded by the ſame Method as <hi>Henry,</hi> beſtowing his Uncles Treaſure freely upon ſuch as either by Arms or Counſel might be uſeful to him. He created ſeveral Noblemen: He releaſed the People of all extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57813:33"/>
Payments, cauſing a large Charter to be drawn up for mitigating the Severity of divers Laws, and bound himſelf by a ſolemn Oath to obſerve the ſame. He granted to the Church and Clergy as great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities as they could demand, and fully exempted them from the Power of the Temporal Magiſtrate for all Offences whatſoever, without the Biſhops Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And to prevent Rebellions, he erected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Caſtles, Forts, and Bulwarks in divers Parts of the Land, and gave leave to the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy to do the like, He gave <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and Uncle to <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, becauſe he ſhould not aſſiſt her, the whole County of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and created his Son <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington:</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, <hi>David</hi> ſoon after ravaged the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts with Fire and Sword in her Quarrel; but being encountred by <hi>Thurſtan</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> he was overthrown, and hardly made his Eſcape into <hi>Scotland,</hi> leaving above Ten thouſand of his Army dead behind him; which Victory was judged to be chiefly occaſioned by the Courage and Policy of <hi>Thurſtan,</hi> who before the Battel openly proclaimed, <hi>That whoever fell therein, ſhould have full Pardon of all his Sins, and certainly enter into Heaven;</hi> which much ſpirited the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his ſixth year <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs landed at <hi>Arundel</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> with onely an hundred and forty Men, and was quickly inforced with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who joyned with her, and her baſe Brother <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>Reynulph</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> with a ſtout Party of <hi>Welchmen. Stephen</hi> made all expedition to meet her, and a bloody Fight began, with equal Succeſs, till at length King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Soldiers left their King almoſt alone, who with his Battel-ax drove back whole Troops of his Enemies, and afterward renewed his Aſſaults, till his Sword flew in pieces; when being now diſarmed, he was taken and carried to <hi>Briſtow</hi>-Caſtle, where he continued about three
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57813:34"/>
Months, and was at laſt ſet at liberty in exchange for the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was taken Priſoner by King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Queen. This Earl <hi>Robert</hi> was one of the moſt valiant Men of that Age; he had one <hi>Stephen Beauchamp</hi> to his Servant, whom he made his onely Favourite, to the great diſlike of all the reſt of his Followers: And being one time very much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in a Battel, he called to ſome of his Company for help; but one bitterly replied, <hi>Call to your</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen <hi>now to help you. Pardon me, pardon me,</hi> ſaid the Earl: <hi>In matters of Love and Wenching I make uſe of my</hi> Stephen; <hi>but in Martial Affairs I wholly depend upon your Courage and Valour,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Victory <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs was trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly received into <hi>Circeter, Oxford, Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> but refuſing to ratifie King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws, and remit ſome ſevere ones, which ſhe harſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, the <hi>Londoners</hi> contrived to ſeiſe her; which ſhe having notice of, fled ſuddenly to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where <hi>Stephen</hi> preſently cloſe beſieged her; who deſpairing of holding it, ſhe and her Followers eſcaped by clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing themſelves in white Linen in a great Snow, and ſo paſſed unknown to the Sea, and got away. The Empreſs being once in the Caſtle of the <hi>Devizes,</hi> was there in great hazard likewiſe; whereupon ſhe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelf to be put into a Coffin, as though dead, and bound faſt with Cords, and ſo, like a dead Corps, ſhe was carried in a Horſe-litter to <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> and ſoon after being weary of theſe continual Troubles, ſhe went into <hi>Normandy.</hi> King <hi>Stephen</hi> preſently ſeiſed all the Caſtles which were kept by the Barons againſt him; to gain which the ſooner, it is related he uſed this Courſe: Having taken the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he put a Rope about his Neck, and ſo led him to the Caſtle of the <hi>Devizes,</hi> held by his Followers, threatning to hang their Biſhop and Maſter, if they did not immediately ſurrender. The like he did by <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who held another Caſtle

upon <hi>Trent,</hi> which was thereupon delivered, and the King ſeiſed all the Treaſure and Goods to his own uſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Troubles being over, the Kingdom for ſome years enjoyed Peace; but <hi>Henry</hi> called <hi>Shortman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

King <hi>Stephen</hi> likewiſe gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very equal Strength to encounter him. Both Armies lay near each other, and ſome went between them every day. In the mean time <hi>Euſtace</hi> the King's Son by miſchance was drowned, though others write, That being in a rage, he ſet fire to ſome Corn-fields belonging to the Abby of <hi>Bury,</hi> becauſe the Monks denied him Money; and afterwards ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down to Dinner, at the firſt Morſel of Bread he put into his Mouth, he fell into a Fit of Madneſs, of which he died.</p>
               <p>The King, though extremely grieved for the Death of his Son, yet began to hearken to Terms of Peace; and at length he adopted Prince <hi>Henry</hi> to his Son, proclaimed him Heir Apparent to the Crown, the Nobles doing Homage to him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and gave him many Gifts, aſſuring him of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. By this Agreement Arms were laid aſide, and

Peace ſucceeded, the Prince with his Followers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where they were joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

them faithleſs, and unuſeful to him. He cauſed all the Forts and Caſtles built by the order or permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Predeceſſor, to be demoliſhed, as giving occaſion of Inſurrections upon the leaſt Diſcontent.

               </p>
               <p>In his latter days many Quarrels hapned between him and <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in all which, <hi>Henry, Jeffry,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> his own Sons, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter, Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> moſt unnaturally joyned with the <hi>French</hi> againſt him, and likewiſe <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scots;</hi> notwithſtanding which, the Courage of King <hi>Henry</hi> prevailed againſt them all, and upon ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he pardoned his Sons and all the reſt: Yet were they juſtly puniſhed by Heaven, <hi>Henry</hi> dying before his Father, in the flower of his Age; and <hi>John,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter King, was poyſoned by a Monk. The Hiſtory of this Kings Reign declares him to be Learned, Wiſe, Juſt, and Valiant; and though he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in many great Affairs, and Wars both in <hi>France, Normandy, Anjou, Ireland,</hi> and other Places, and never received any extraordinary Tax or Subſidy from his Subjects, yet he left to his Succeſſor above Nine hundred thouſand Pound in Money, beſides Jewels, rich Houſholdſtuff, and all manner of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Proviſions. And though in moſt Tranſactions he was proſperous and ſucceſsful, yet in three things he was very unhappy. Firſt, In the unnatural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and Rebellions of his own Sons. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In his inordinate Love to <hi>Roſamond,</hi> his endeared Concubine, who was admirably fair, but exceeding wanton, and thereby wholly alienated his Affections from <hi>Eleanor</hi> his renowned Queen, and enſlaved himſelf to her Will and Pleaſure; ſo that while ſhe lived, ſhe was ſeldom from his Right-hand; and after
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57813:37"/>
her Death (which <hi>Eleanor</hi> procured by Poyſon) he cauſed her with great Pomp to be ſolemnly buried at <hi>Godſtow</hi> near <hi>Oxford,</hi> fixing this Epitaph on her Tomb:
<q>
                     <lg>

               </p>
               <p>The third Infelicity of his Reign, was the great Diſſention between him and <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> the proud and inſolent Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued full ſeven years, with all manner of aſperity and fierceneſs: For <hi>Theobald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had ſo great a favour for <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> a <hi>Londoner,</hi> of mean Parentage, that he made him Archdeacon of his own Church, and ſtill advancing him, at laſt, by the Power he had with the King, made him Lord Chancellor of <hi>England;</hi> which ſo pufft up <hi>Becket,</hi> that he grew extreme haughty, yet ſtill ſhewed great Reſpect to the King, who thereupon conſtantly encreaſed his Lands and Revenues, which daily heightned him more. <hi>Theobald</hi> dying, the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Becket</hi> to be Archbiſhop; after which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcover his ungrateful Humour: For going privately to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was there inveſted in his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick by the Pope, of whom he received the Pall, and was made Legate; and then returning into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was much diſcountenanced by the King: but <hi>Becket</hi> ſlighting it, on a ſudden ſurrendred his Chancellorſhip and Great Seal; of which the King deſiring a Reaſon, he obſtinately refuſed to give any. Theſe Quarrels encouraged the debauched part of the Clergy to commit many Inſolencies and Villanies, for which they received ſmall Puniſhment, though their Crimes were Murder, Theft, and Robbery;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57813:37"/>
for not being under the Juriſdiction of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but tried by thoſe of their own Profeſſion, their greateſt Offences were connived at, or very ſlightly examined, whereby many grievous Enormities hapned in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King ſummoned a Parliament where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Law of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> exempting the Clergy from the Authority of the Temporal Judge, for any Crime whatſoever, was repealed, and the ancient Laws again revived and enforced. This was very much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Becket,</hi> and ſome few Biſhops more of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but after ſeveral Conferences, theſe Laws were confirmed, and ſubſcribed by all the Biſhops but <hi>Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> who would by no means aſſent thereto, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting this Clauſe, <hi>Salvo Ordine ſuo, Saving the Order of the Clergy,</hi> which would have utterly invalidated all thoſe Laws. At which the King being enraged, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of the other Biſhops, who dreaded the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>Becket</hi> took a ſolemn Oath to allow of thoſe Laws; whereat the King turned his Fury into Kindneſs toward <hi>Becket,</hi> and immediately cauſed an Indenture to be drawn betwixt himſelf and the two Archbiſhops, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying their Submiſſion to this Oath, which was ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the King, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>York;</hi> but <hi>Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> again relapſing into his former Obſtinacy, not onely refuſed it, but expreſſed much ſorrow for his former Oath, and deſired to be abſolved there from by the Pope, which was done accordingly, ſome private Penance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being enjoyned him, who required him not to yield, but to perſiſt conſtantly in his opinion.

               <p>Theſe Proceedings, and eſpecially his being turned out of the Abby for fear of the Kings Anger, much troubled <hi>Becket;</hi> yet then <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> though young King <hi>Henry</hi> had married his Daughter, cheriſht and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him: But the King being tired with theſe Turmoils, goes privately into <hi>France,</hi> and in the preſence of the <hi>French</hi> King confers with <hi>Becket,</hi> offering him, <hi>That if he would now take the Oath, and ſubſcribe the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſhould return into</hi> England, <hi>and be reſtored to his Favour and Dignities, with all his Friends.</hi> But he proudly anſwered, <hi>That if the King would let him ſwear and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with this Exception,</hi> Salvo Honore Dei, Saving the Honour of God, <hi>he would then conſent.</hi> This angred the King more than ever, as intimating, That thoſe Laws were diſhonourable to Almighty God, and therefore he would obey no farther than he pleaſed; but <hi>Becket</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly perſiſted, alledging, <hi>That he feared none but God; and ſince thoſe Laws did derogate from ancient Cuſtoms and Privileges of the Church, and robbed God of his Honour, the King ſhould never eſtabliſh them by his Conſent as long as he lived.</hi>

                  </abbr> he gave him his Liberty. In ſhort time he arrived in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and raiſing a ſtout Army, he quickly revenged himſelf on the <hi>French</hi> for their Injuries againſt him, and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that had been unjuſtly taken from him.</p>

The King being mollified by this ingenuous Confeſſion, ſaid, <hi>God grant that I may as eaſily forget your Offences, as you may remember wherein you have offended;</hi> and then not onely gave him his Pardon, but received him into his ſpecial Grace and Favour. He then returned into <hi>England,</hi> and ſummoning a Parliament, he cauſed himſelf to be crowned the ſecond time, impoſing very heavy Taxes upon the People for his Ranſom, and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Treaſures of ſeveral Monaſteries: And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his own Revenue, he reſumed into his Hands all thoſe Honours, Mannors, Caſtles, Privileges, and Offices, which he had formerly ſold to his Subjects, forcing them to be contented with the Profits they had received.

                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> toward his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; the reſt <hi>Leopold</hi> forgave him, being curſt by the Pope for making <hi>Richard</hi> a Priſoner coming from the Holy War.</p>
               <p>After this, the King tranſported another Army into <hi>France,</hi> where he fought very ſucceſsfully againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and in one Battel took 100 Knights on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, 200 great Horſe, 140 of them being barbed and armed with Iron. In theſe Wars <hi>Philip</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs,</hi> and Peer of the Blood-Royal, fighting valiantly in a Skirmiſh, was taken Priſoner, and order'd to be committed and Irons put on his Legs, as being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Enemy to King <hi>Richard.</hi> This hard Uſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complained of to the Pope, he writ earneſtly to <hi>Richard</hi> not to detain his dear Son, an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon, and a Shepherd of the Lords, but to ſend him back to his Flock. The King in a pleaſant Bravery ſent the Head-piece, Back, and Breaſt of Iron in which he was taken, to the Pope, with the Queſtion of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons to their Father, <hi>Behold, this we found him in: Is this thy Sons Coat?

               </p>
               <p>Soon after King <hi>Richard</hi> was cut off in the midſt of all his Glory; for the Lord <hi>Limoges</hi> having found a vaſt Treaſure of Gold and Silver, he ſent the greateſt part thereof to him, as Lord thereof: but the King reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to have all, came to beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Chalms,</hi> where he judged the Riches were. The Garriſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to yield themſelves, and all therein, if they might ſave their Lives and Limbs: But the King would accept of no Terms, bidding them defend themſelves, and that he was reſolved to win it by his Sword, and hang them all. Whereupon an Archer ſtanding on the Wall, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his opportunity, charging his Steel Bow with a ſquare Arrow, and praying that by that Shot he might deliver the Innocent from Oppreſſion and the King juſt then taking view of the Caſtle, he wounded him in the Shoulder, which was made extreme painful by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful

Chirurgeon. However, the Aſſault was renewed, the Caſtle taken, and all put to the Sword, by the Kings Command, but this too skilful Archer, who boldly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Action; for being demanded, <hi>How he durſt ſhoot at the Perſon of a King?</hi> he replied, <hi>That the King had ſlain his Father and his two Brothers with his own Hand, and that he was exceeding glad he was now ſo happily revenged.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Anſwer, the King gave him 100 <hi>s.</hi> and his Liberty; but yet after the King was dead, one of his Captains took him, flea'd him alive, and then hanged him. He died of his Wound, 1199. having reigned vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriouſly Ten years, and in the Forty ſecond year of his Age, leaving no Legitimate Son behind him.</p>

The whole Courſe of his Government was attended with continual Troubles, his two great Perſecutors being Pope <hi>innocent</hi> the Third, and <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>France.</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> being envious at <hi>Englands</hi> Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur took all Occaſions to diſturb <hi>John;</hi> as by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> animating him to regain the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and ſupplying him with Men and Money; and the <hi>Normans</hi> joyning with them, <hi>Arthur</hi> won many ſtrong Places in <hi>Normandy:</hi> But King <hi>John</hi>'s Lieutenants made a ſtout Defence, till he himſelf went over with a ſtrong Army, and fought many Battels with his Nephew; but at laſt both Sides being wearied with equal Loſſes, they made a Truce, which was again broken by the incitement of the <hi>French</hi> King, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing <hi>Arthur</hi> double the Forces he had before, they both entred <hi>Normandy,</hi> plundring and burning many Towns and Villages. But <hi>John,</hi> who wanted nothing but Money, was voluntarily ſupplied by his Lords, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Commons, with a large Tax, they being grieved to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Territories thus deſtroyed, and all the ſtout Youth voluntarily liſted themſelves for the Service; whereby <hi>John</hi> ſoon landed in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>

where thouſands more reſorted to him, ſo that ſoon after the two Armies met, and fought deſperately; but at length the <hi>French</hi> gave way, and <hi>Arthur</hi> was taken Priſoner, and ſent to <hi>Roan,</hi> where leaping from the Walls, with deſign to eſcape, he was drowned in the Ditch; though others write, That he came to a violent Death by King <hi>John</hi>'s Order.</p>
               <p>However, the <hi>French</hi> King improved the Report to the beſt advantage, peremptorily citing King <hi>John</hi> to come and do him Homage for the Dukedom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and likewiſe to appear at a ſet Day, to be tried by his Peers for Treaſon and Murder. But <hi>John</hi> not obeying his Summons, was by the King and Peers of <hi>France</hi> diſinherited and condemned, and according to the Sentence they proceeded againſt him: For ſeveral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility joyning with <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being careleſs, the <hi>French</hi> with a powerful Army took in moſt of the Towns in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which hapned by the fault of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords and Biſhops; for when the King was ready to embarque for <hi>Normandy,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Hubert</hi> forbid him, and the Peers refuſed to attend him; upon which the King laid great Fines upon them, and ſeiſed upon the Eſtate of <hi>Hubert,</hi> who died ſoon after.</p>
               <p>But now Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> his other Enemy, begins to play his Part, and vex him more dangerouſly than <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had done: For <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being dead, the Monks of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> in that City, without the Kings Knowledge or Licenſe, elected one <hi>Reynold</hi> a Monk to ſucceed him, and made him take an Oath to go immediately to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Inveſtiture, and receive his Pall of the Pope. The King hereat was much diſpleaſed; ſo that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his Wrath, they made a new Election, and with his Approbation choſe <hi>John Gray</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich;</hi> and the King preſently ſent Letters and Ambaſſadors to the Pope, entreating him to confirm his Choice. But <hi>Innocent,</hi> after the Example of his inſolent Predeceſſors, confirmed the firſt Election; whereat <hi>John</hi> was enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: yea, divers of thoſe Monks who choſe him, now joyned with the King againſt him, alledging the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57813:44"/>
was made in the Night, and not in open Day, and was therefore null and void.</p>
               <p>At length the Pope, to end the Controverſie, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> a Man in the Popes Intereſts, and ordered the Monks to elect him; which King <hi>John</hi> forbid: But the Papal Command was obeyed, and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> was elected Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the King, that in his Letters to the Pope he ſolemnly proteſted, <hi>That thenceforward he would take ſtrict Account of thoſe Subjects, who, for any Matters of Right and Juſtice, ſhould run gadding to</hi> Rome; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he had Biſhops, Nobles, and Magiſtrates of his own, who according to the Cuſtoms of the Kingdom could and ſhould determine all Controverſies in Church and State; and, That he would rather expoſe himſelf to a thouſand Deaths, than baſely and ſervilely ſubject himſelf and his Kingdom to the inſolent and unreaſonable Commands of the Pope.</hi> But <hi>Innocent</hi> haughtily anſwered, <hi>That the Election of</hi> Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>ſhould ſtand;</hi> requiring the King to give him quiet Poſſeſſion, to recal ſuch Monks as were baniſh'd on his Account, and reſtore their Eſtates, or otherwiſe he did authorize four Biſhops to interdict and curſe the King and the Realm.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John</hi> obſerving that the four Biſhops appointed grew very Arrogant with their new Authority, and thought long e're he ſignified his Reſolution, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſeiſed upon their Eſtates, and declared, That he reſolved to take the ſame Courſe with all thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any Promotions or Inveſtitures from <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> or went or appealed to <hi>Rome</hi> upon any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without Licenſe; or that ſhould execute any Command of the Pope within this Kingdom. Upon this the Pope ſent two proud Legats into <hi>England, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> who perſuaded the King to agree with <hi>Langton,</hi> and reſtore the Prior and Monks of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> to their Lands and Offices: To which <hi>John,</hi> for fear of the Popes Curſe, and to prevent any further Quarrels, yielded; onely deſiring to be excuſed as to the Election of the Archbiſhop: yet proteſting, That if another might be choſen, he would prefer <hi>Langton</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57813:45"/>
to ſome other Biſhoprick. But the Legats, in ſtead of gratifying the King in his Requeſt, proceeded immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to excommunicate him, pronouncing the Popes Curſe againſt him, and abſolving all his Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance toward him: Yea, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all Chriſtian Princes to make War upon him, as the Arch and Grand Enemy of the Church of God: Nay, he publiſhed the Sentence of Deprivation againſt him, and gave his Crown and Kingdom to <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, of which he was to take Poſſeſſion as ſoon as he could expel or murder <hi>John,</hi> either by ſome ſecret Plot, or by open Violence and Hoſtility.</p>
               <p>Thus did this Unholy Father, out of his Uſurping Arrogance and Helliſh Pride, preſume to diſpoſe of Kings and Kingdoms at his pleaſure, and all on the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Pretence of the Honour of God and Holy Church. But the King not fearing theſe Thunderbolts, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſtand his Ground; and to that end, took a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath of his Subjects for his Defence, and their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: And then raiſing a ſtrong Army, he entred <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt King <hi>Alexander,</hi> for ſupporting divers Rebellious Clergymen, and others, who adhered to the Popes Authority againſt him; but the King of <hi>Scots</hi> finding he ſhould gain nothing but Ruine and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Oppoſition, humbly ſubmitted himſelf to King <hi>John,</hi> and an entire Friendſhip and Amity was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King reſolving to take Poſſeſſion of the Popes Gift, provided great Forces to invade the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but by the diligence of King <hi>John,</hi> 300 of his Ships, loaden with Corn, Victuals, and other Warlike Proviſions, were ſeiſed, and thereby <hi>Philip</hi>'s vain Hopes at that time prevented. However, the Pope accurſed the King again and again; ſo that deſpairing of ever b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing quiet, without the Advice of his Council or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, he all on a ſudden ſubmitted himſelf upon his Knees to <hi>Pandulphus</hi> the Popes Legat, confeſſing his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and begging Pardon; and by a Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in Writing, under his Hand and Seal, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Crown (and Scepter) to the Pope, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57813:45"/>
                  <hi>Pandulphus</hi> kept four days for the Popes Uſe, and then gave them both back to <hi>John</hi> and his Heirs, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to hold his Kingdom from the Pope, and pay 1000 Marks a year to him as a Tribute. This baſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſo alienated the Affections of his Nobility, and Men of War, that they revolted from him, and fled to his Enemy the <hi>French</hi> King, who reſolved to make his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> Monarch of this Realm, and ſent him hither with a numerous Army, where he did much miſchief, though often encountred. But the Pope being now for King <hi>John,</hi> forbid <hi>Philip</hi> to proceed any further againſt him, ſince he and his Kingdom were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him and the Church, and that the Crown was held from the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> King refuſed to obey, affirming, <hi>That no King could give away his Kingdom, nor the Protection of his Subjects, which were committed to him by God, without the Conſent of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons; and that therefore this Kingdom could not be holden of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor protected by her.</hi> This Anſwer ſo vexed the Pope, that he preſently ſent Cardinal <hi>Guallo</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> who curſed King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son, with all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility who took part with them.</p>
               <p>Though the wiſer ſort little regarded what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal did, yet the Common People and Soldiers, who were ignorantly devout, were ſo amazed, that they fled to their Houſes and Ships, and others entred into the Houſes and Grounds of the Excommunicate Lords and Gentry, robbing and ſpoiling all before them, ſuppoſing that their Robberies were pleaſing and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious before God, by which means the Lords were much diſtreſſed, and even ready to ſtarve for want of Suſtenance, none daring to relieve them; ſo that they were at laſt neceſſitated to throw themſelves at the Kings Feet, and crave his Mercy: who, though by their means he had been reduced to the utmoſt Extremities, yet being of a merciful Diſpoſition, he eaſily pardoned them, and reſtored them to their Honours and Lands: By which means the <hi>French</hi> finding themſelves forſaken, were forced to return back to <hi>France,</hi> and all their vaſt Deſigns periſhed in a moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57813:46"/>But the Pope intending to make his Proceedings againſt King <hi>John</hi> a Preſident to other Princes, aſſembled a General Council at <hi>Lateran,</hi> wherein he gave a full Account of all Tranſactions, with the Kings Grant of his Kingdom, and the Tenure whereby it was held from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And in the ſame Council, <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon, Raymond</hi> Earl of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and divers other Sovereign Princes, were Excommunicated, and others Interdicted, with their Kingdoms and Provinces, for Hereſie, as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, though the real Deſign was to make Princes Slaves and Vaſſals to the Will and Pleaſure of the Pope, and to enrich himſelf with their Ruine: For in this Council, wherein they ſay were 1215 Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, it was poſitively concluded, <hi>That the Pope might depoſe Kings, abſolve their Subjects from their Allegiance, and give away their Kingdoms. Likewiſe, That ſuch as ſpoke evil of the Pope, ſhould be damned in Hell; and that none ſhould be Emperour, till he had ſworn Homage to the Pope, and had received his Crown from him.</hi> Alſo <hi>Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> were then decreed and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>And thus all theſe Troubles, which had continued ten years, came now to an end: But the Clergy would by no means be reconciled to King <hi>John;</hi> for ſuch was their inveterate Hatred toward him, that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Kindneſs, he was poyſoned by a Monk at <hi>Swinſtead</hi> Abby near <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who to make all ſure, poyſoned himſelf, that he might not fail to do the ſame to the King.

               </p>
               <p>He was Politick, and exceeding Valiant, Bountiful and Liberal to Strangers, not given to Revenge; for when he was ſhewed how Honourably one of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Barons was Intombed, and adviſed to deface the Monument, <hi>No, by no means,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I wiſh all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

was called, wherein the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> were revived, and the <hi>Grand Charter,</hi> called then <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> containing ſeveral Laws for the Liberty, Eaſe, and Security of the Subject, was confirmed; and a Tax granted for ſending an Army into <hi>France,</hi> to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Poictiers</hi> and <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> under <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings Brother, which had been injuriouſly ſeiſed by the <hi>French</hi> for ſome years: Thoſe Provinces were ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained wholly back to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which in a ſhort time produced a Peace between both Nations.

Twelve Peers; but the Lords and Commons were ſo far from remitting any thing, that they further ratified all that had been done; and the Archbiſhop, with nine other Biſhops, publickly denounced a ſolemn Curſe againſt all that by Advice or Aſſiſtance ſhould oppoſe thoſe Laws, or the Authority of the Twelve Peers. This ſtill encreaſed the Kings Diſcontent, who could take no delight in any thing he enjoyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went over to divert himſelf with <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who treated him with all manner of Kindneſs and Magnificence.</p>

Bulls from Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, whereby the King, and all thoſe who had ſworn to maintain the new Laws and Ordinances, and to ſupport the Authority of the Twelve Peers, were freely abſolved, and diſcharged from keeping thoſe Oaths. But this being kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, the Twelve Peers ruled all, and were ſo diligent in their Buſineſs, that they left the King nothing to do; ſo that he was King in Name onely, not in Power. Soon after, <hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> being Lord Chief Juſtice, and a great Favourite with the King, was removed by the Twelve Peers, being charged with Corruption, and Arbitrary Proceedings: They likewiſe diſmiſſed ſuch Sheriffs and Juſtices as the King had made, chuſing others in their Places; which ſo deeply wounded the Kings Mind, that he reſolved immediately to make uſe of the Popes Bulls, and thereupon cauſed them to be ſolemnly proclaimed in <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>That all who did any way ſupport thoſe Laws, or the Twelve Peers, ſhould be committed to Priſon.</hi> He likewiſe took an Oath of all above twelve years old, in and about <hi>London,</hi> to be true to him and his Heirs. But the Lords were not to be frighted, declaring, <hi>That they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rather to die, than recede from the Acts of that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſembly:</hi> And judging that the King was deſigning ſomething againſt them, they went into the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> where they raiſed a ſtrong Army, and then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly addreſſed themſelves to the King by Letters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting their Fidelity to him, and beſeeching his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, That for the Honour of God, the Good of his Soul, and the Welfare of his People, he would renounce and forſake thoſe Counſels which were given him to ſuppreſs the Ordinances of <hi>Oxford</hi> and the Twelve Peers.</p>
               <p>The King was much diſpleaſed with theſe Letters, but returned no Anſwer: Whereupon the Barons marched with a ſtrong Army toward <hi>London,</hi> carrying a Banner wherein the Kings Arms were curiouſly wrought.

This Sentence the Lords judged Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and therefore fly again to Arms on th Marches, deſtroying all that belonged to Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> who counſelled the King to withſtand them.

After this they marched to <hi>London</hi> in Triumph; hut King <hi>Henry</hi> hearing that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> had raiſed Forces at <hi>Northampton</hi> he levied a ſtrong Army, and took the Town by Aſſault, making the two Commanders and many others Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>The Barons being powerful, were herewith nothing diſcouraged; yet ſtill ſent Letters to the King, with humble Proteſtations of their Fidelity, if the new Laws were obſerved: But <hi>Henry,</hi> his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> ſent the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons an abſolute Defiance and wi h their Armies they met at <hi>Lewes</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where, after a bloody Fight, the two Kings, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſeveral other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, were taken Priſoners, above 20000 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain: After which, both Sides inclined to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Yet ſoon after, the two great Earls of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> differed about theſe Laws; and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> joyning with <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> a cruel Battel was ſought at <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> wherein <hi>Simon Montford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and his Son Sir <hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> were ſlain, and the Power of the Barons was utterly defeated: And a Parliament being called, no Man durſt then contradict the Kings Will; ſo that all the Laws made at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Authority of the Twelve Peers, all Patents, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Inſtruments whatſoever, relating to what was Enacted in that called <hi>The Mad Parliament,</hi> were brought forth, and publickly damned, cancelled, and made void.

               <p>Having thus fleec'd the Clergy, he laid a new Tax upon Wooll and Hides exported out of the Kingdom, and required the tenth part of every Mans Eſtate to be paid him, to maintain his Wars. He cauſed the Clergy to bring into his Treaſury all ſuch Sums of Money as they had promiſed to pay the Pope for the War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and took up 100000 Quarters of Wheat, which he ſent to his Armies in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where they fought with doubtful Succeſs, ſometimes winning, and then again loſing.</p>

               <p>Having ſo happily performed this, he then turned his Arms to <hi>France,</hi> who, to divert him, animated the <hi>Scots</hi> again to rebell; but King <hi>Edward</hi> reſolving not to leave the <hi>French,</hi> if poſſible, without fighting, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill in <hi>Normandy</hi> ſending Orders to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and others, to ſuppreſs that Rebellion, which they did with a very bloody ſlaughter; Upon which the <hi>French</hi> King perceiving himſelf diſappointed, would not venture to engage the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, but ſent honourable Propoſitions of Peace which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the King, and a general Peace was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

For no ſooner was his Head adorned with the Imperial Crown, but his Heart longed for the debauched <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> who though baniſhed by his Father, and <hi>Edward</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an Oath that he ſhould never return, yet hearing how things went, he ſoon came back, and was received with extraordinary Joy and Content by the King. The Nobles being extremely concerned, as fearing the ruine of Church and State by his Inſolence, preſumed to put the King in mind of his Oath; but as his Conſcience did not trouble him for the breach thereof, ſo their Diſlike increaſed his Love; ſo that <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> and none but <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> managed all, being created Baron of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Treaſurer of all his Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Treaſure; who fearing a Storm, privately ſent beyond Sea a maſſy Table and Treſſels of beaten Gold, with many other rich Ornaments and Jewels. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enticed the King to banquet and drink without meaſure, and to leave the Society of <hi>Iſabel</hi> his Queen, Daughter to King <hi>Philip the Fair</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles murmured; the Common People talked boldly; his own Servants privately told him of the Villanies of <hi>Gaveſton:</hi> yet he diſregarded the firſt, and frowned on the laſt. But yet perceiving he ſhould not be able to protect him againſt the Importunity of the Lords, he was ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was no ſooner arrived, but Meſſengers with Letters of Comfort, Plate, Jewels, Gold, and Silver in abundance, and Promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Advancement, were ſent him by the King; ſo that it ſeemed rather an Honourable Ambaſſy, than Baniſhment.</p>
               <p>During <hi>Gaveſton</hi>'s abſence, the King was ſo melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſcontented, that his Nobility, in hopes of his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57813:55"/>
Reformation, moved the King for his return. When he came back, his Pride and Inſolence increaſed ſo much, that he publickly gloried in his miſleading the King, and abuſed the Lords to their Faces; ſo that being no longer able to ſuffer his Impudence, they beſieged him in a ſtrong Caſtle, whither he fled, which having won, they took <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> and cut off his Head; at which the King was ſo highly incenſed, that he ſought all ways to revenge his Death: And to vex the Nobility, he took into his neareſt Familiarity and Counſels the two <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> Father and Son, Men as wicked, and odious to the Lords and People, as the former, who perſwaded him to frequent the Company of Harlots and Concubines, and utterly to neglect his Queen. But this evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of himſelf and his Kingdom kindled new Heats between him and his Subjects, of which <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> taking the advantage, came from <hi>Norway</hi> (whither he had fled) into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was joyfully received, and crowned King of that Kingdom; and raiſing a puiſſant Army, he entred <hi>England,</hi> burning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all before him, till he was encountred by the King; but <hi>Edward</hi> fighting a Battel within <hi>Scotland,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Overthrow, with the loſs of many thouſand Soldiers, beſides <hi>Gilbert de Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> forty two Lords, and above fourſcore Knights and Barons who were taken Priſoners, and he ſhamefully forced to fly into <hi>England</hi> for Safety; where one <hi>John Powdras,</hi> a Tanners Son of <hi>Exeter,</hi> confronted him, affirming, That he was the Legitimate Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, and that he was changed in his Cradle by his Nurſe for a Carters Child, offering ſeveral Proofs for the ſame, and, among others, alledging the unkingly and baſe Qualities of <hi>Edward;</hi> upon which many of the Vulgar flock'd to him: But being taken, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his Treaſon, he was condemned and executed.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the almoſt impregnable Caſtle of <hi>Berwick</hi> was betray'd to <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and ſuch a great Famine and Murrain of Cattel happened as was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever known; Likewiſe about two hundred High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waymen and Thieves, Clothed like Gray Friers, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57813:56"/>
and Murdered the Inhabitants of the North part without reſpect to Age or Sex; the <hi>Scots</hi> alſo raiſed an Army, and made ſuch Devaſtation, that the Famine increaſed wofully, ſo that the living could ſcarce bury the dead, and the reſt were forc't to eat Rats, Mice, Cats, Dogs, Horſes and the like. <hi>Edward</hi> marching to ſuppreſs the <hi>Scots,</hi> received a ſecond overthrow, more lamentable than the former, returning back with much diſgrace, leaving his Northern Subjects a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs prey to their Barbarous Enemys. The Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obſerving the miſeries of the Kingdom daily to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, complain of the Miſgovernment of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> telling him plainly, <hi>They had ſo much intereſt in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the Government, that they were bound to inform him of his miſdemeanors, and the miſ-managment of his two Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Counſellors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King knowing their complaints to be true, yet reſolving not to part with his Favourites, contrived to ſurpriſe thoſe Noble-men who moſt hated the <hi>Spencers,</hi> and giving them a pleaſing anſwer, preſently after ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned a Parliament, pretending to reform what was amiſs, to the great joy both of Lords and Commons; but the Barons ſuſpecting trechery repaired to <hi>London</hi> with a ſtrong Army of their followers, all clothed in the ſame Livery, which highly offended the King, becauſe he was afraid they would deprive him of his dear Minions, which happened accordingly; for it was enacted by Parliament, That the two <hi>Spencers</hi> ſhould be baniſhed for ever, and not to return upon pain of death, after which they were ſoon ſent away; at which moſt Men were pleaſed, but the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſcovered his anger againſt the Lords, who had forced his conſent to their Baniſhment, which he made appear upon this occaſion: The younger <hi>Spencer</hi> having got a few Ships together, robbed and pillaged the Merchants of <hi>England,</hi> and all other Nations in the Narrow Seas, upon which they Petitioned that a Fleet might be ſet out to ſeize and Execute him as a Pyrate and notorious Thief, the King ſmiled, ſeeming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce thereat, and inſtead of puniſhing him, pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57813:56"/>
them both, recalled them from Baniſhment, to deſpight the Barons, and raiſed them to higher Honour and Offices than before.</p>
               <p>The Lords inraged hereat, eſpecially ſince the <hi>Spencers</hi> affronted them openly upon all occaſions, they reſolved on revenge, and to that purpoſe immediately raiſe a ſtrong Army, and take the Field; and the King with the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> and ſome other of the Nobles did the like, and many ſharp encounters paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, the Lords forgetting they undutifully fought againſt their Soveraign, and the King, that his Cruelty had compelled them to take Arms: In the end when many of the Barons, and thouſands of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents were ſlain they fled, and were purſued by the King who took the Earls of <hi>Lancaſter, Hereford,</hi> and many other Lords, two and twenty of whom were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in diverſe parts of the Realm, to the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the People. This ſucceſs made the <hi>Spencers</hi> yet more inſolent, ſo that now they made their Will a Law in all things, and preſuming that all would be done they deſired, they perſuaded the King to call a Parliament at <hi>York,</hi> in which he created his eldeſt Son <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Aquitan;</hi> Old <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> was made Earl of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Andrew Harkly</hi> who was very active againſt the Lords, Earl of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> he likewiſe exacted the ſixth penny of all Mens Eſtates in <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereat the People grievouſly complained, alledging, that they were quite impoveriſhed by Famine, and Dearth, but eſpecially by reaſon of the diſorders in the Government.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> having notice that K. <hi>Edward</hi> reſolved to revenge the wrongs committed againſt his Subjects, under <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> their uſurping King, to divert him, invaded <hi>Ireland</hi> with ſtrong Force, but the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forewarned, had ſufficiently provided againſt their landing, ſo that moſt of them were ſlain, and the reſt forced to fly to their Ships, and return ſhamefully home: The King now thinking himſelf invincible, marches with a brave Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the

               <p>AT the Age of Fifteen years <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was Crowned King, his depoſed Father being then alive. He was chiefly counſelled in his younger years by Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> his Mother, <hi>Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer;</hi> which Knight, to ingratiate himſelf with the Queen, was a chief Inſtrument in the Murder of the late King. In his ſecond year the <hi>Scots</hi> proclaimed War againſt <hi>England;</hi> whereupon King <hi>Edward</hi> with an Army of fifty four thouſand Men, and attended with Sir <hi>John Heynault,</hi> the L. <hi>Beamont,</hi> and five hundred Lords and Gentlemen, marched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he purſued his lurking Enemies who fled into Woods, Mountains, and Hills, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tired the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, ſo that he returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any memorable Action, and then married <hi>Philip</hi> the Daughter of <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Heynault,</hi> and calling a Parliament at <hi>Northampton,</hi> the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> and <hi>Walter Stapleton</hi> were attainted of High Treaſon; at which time by the advice of the Queen and <hi>Mortimer,</hi> a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Peace was made with the <hi>Scots,</hi> whereby that King was diſcharged from doing homage to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and the great Charter called <hi>Ragman,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the late King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all his Nobility under their Hands and Scals did acknowledge their Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> was delivered up, and the Kings Siſter <hi>Jane</hi> was married to <hi>David</hi> Son and Heir to K. <hi>R.

               <p>
                  <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> was now made Earl of <hi>March,</hi> which did much diſcontent the Nobility, eſpecially after they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57813:59"/>
ſaw, that by his power with the King, and Familiarity with the Queen, he had trecherouſly procured the Earl of Kent the Kings Uncle to be beheaded; but by Divine Vengeance, <hi>Mortimer</hi> himſelf was charged by the State with theſe Trayterous Articles. 1, <hi>That he had wickedly procured the murther of the late King.</hi> 2. <hi>That by falſe and malicious accuſations he had cauſed the King to cut off the Head of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, who was Noble, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, Valiant, and a main Pillar of the Commonwealth.</hi> 3. <hi>That he had too familiarly converſed with the Queen Mother, to her juſt reproach, and the Kings diſhonour.</hi> 4. <hi>That for a Bribe of twenty thouſand pound, he had procured the releaſe of the</hi> Scots <hi>Homage.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>That he had cheated the King of his Jewels and Treaſure, converting them to his own uſe.</hi> For theſe horrid Treaſons he was condemned and Executed in the ſame manner as young <hi>Spencer;</hi> and Q. <hi>Iſabel</hi> was committed to a ſtrong Caſtle, where ſhe continued above thirty years after, and then died.</p>
               <p>In his fifth year <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire King <hi>Edward</hi> to do Homage for the Dutchy of <hi>Guyen,</hi> which he unwillingly performed, his Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith offended, alledging, That in the Right of Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> his Mother, the Crown of <hi>France</hi> belonged to him, and that he therefore ought not to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged any Fealty at all. The King then ſent to <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to reſtore the Caſtle of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and do him Homage for the Kingdom; but <hi>David</hi> ſtoutly anſwered, <hi>That his Father won that Caſtle by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and he would hold it by the Sword; and, That his Father never acknowledged any Subjection; and if any had been due, yet King</hi> Edward <hi>had releaſed him from it.</hi> The King being of a great Spirit, was reſolved to revenge theſe Affronts, by conquering both <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and to that end, he preſently ſent an Army againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and over-run the better part of that Country without reſiſtance, taking <hi>Berwick,</hi> and Crowning <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baliol</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom he committed the Government of <hi>Berwick</hi> Caſtle; and two years after he again marched into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſetled this new King on his Throne, receiving his Homage, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57813:59"/>
reſtored ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords to their Eſtates, which by the Peace with King <hi>Bruce</hi> they were deprived of. <hi>David</hi> the depoſed King fled into <hi>France,</hi> and after two years, by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> King, landed ſome Forces in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but King <hi>Edward</hi> ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred and routed them, and then returned victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his tenth year <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King gave the Earldom of <hi>Artois</hi> away by Sentence from <hi>Robert Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois,</hi> to <hi>Maud</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Aunt to this <hi>Robert;</hi> which ſo incenſed him, that he ſaid, <hi>By me</hi> Philip <hi>was made King, and by me he ſhall be again depoſed.</hi> For theſe Words he was proclaimed a Traytor to the Crown throughout all <hi>France,</hi> ſo that to ſave his Life he fled into <hi>England,</hi> where, for his former Service to Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> and her Son when in <hi>France,</hi> he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably received and entertained by King <hi>Edward,</hi> who knew him to be a wiſe and valiant Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made him Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and loved him ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, that he never undertook any Matter of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence without his Advice. This Noble Knight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually informed the King of his Right to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> by his Mother Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> and that with ſuch convincing Reaſons and Perſuaſions, that <hi>Edward</hi> began now in earneſt to contrive the attaining thereof, negotiating privately with the Earl of <hi>Heynault</hi> his Wives Father, and Brother-in-Law to the <hi>French</hi> King, and with Sir <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Heynault</hi> Lord <hi>Beaumont</hi> his Brother, and ſeveral other Princes and States of <hi>Germany,</hi> who encouraged and aſſiſted him therein, creating him Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car-General of the Empire, by which he had Power to command the Nobility and Commons of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to aid him in his Enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were ſecretly conſulting in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> little ſuſpected he was to fight for his Crown with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore at the Importunity of Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the Eleventh, he had prepared a greater Army for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> than ever any Chriſtian Prince did before him, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with all Neceſſaries for three years; and the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57813:60"/>
Government of his Kingdom he committed to his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy.</hi> Being juſt ready to depart, he had News of the Pretenſions and Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore thought it more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to defend his Kingdom at home, than to go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a frivolous Errand abroad. In the mean time King <hi>Edward</hi> having by many Politick Devices drained his Subjects Purſes, inſomuch that for want of Money a fat Ox was ſold for a Noble, a fat Sheep for Six pence, ſix Pigeons for a Penny, and a Quarter of Wheat for Two ſhillings, he with his Queen ſailed to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he concluded the Methods of the War with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and then returning into <hi>England,</hi> raiſed a ſtrong Army of 27000 fighting Men, which he landed in <hi>France</hi> about Autumn.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King having an Army of 60000 Soldiers, and accompanied with the Kings of <hi>Bohemia, Navar,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Five Dukes, Twenty ſix Earls, and above 4000 Lords and Knights, entred the Field, where he found <hi>Edward</hi> prepared for Battel; but by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Counteſs of <hi>Heynault,</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Siſter, and Mother to King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Wife, a Ceſſation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and King <hi>Edward</hi> with his Nobles and Soldiers returned to <hi>England.</hi> Yet four years after, <hi>Edward</hi> again met with the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who deſired the <hi>Flemings</hi> to joyn with them; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, unleſs <hi>Edward</hi> would entitle himſelf <hi>King of France,</hi> and Quarter the Arms of <hi>France</hi> with thoſe of <hi>England;</hi> and laſtly, would, as King of <hi>France</hi> releaſe them from a Bond of Two Millions of <hi>Florens,</hi> whereby they were obliged not to make War with the King of <hi>France.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> ſoon yielded to all their Deſires; whereupon they obliged themſelves by a ſolemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in Writing, under their Hands and Seals to aſſiſt him to the utmoſt. In the mean time the <hi>French</hi> Kings Navy landed ſome thouſands of Men at <hi>Southampton,</hi> burning the Town, and Villages thereabouts. Upon his return the King called a Parliament, who raiſed ſo great a Tax, that the People turned their Prayers into Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: He likewiſe borrowed great Sums of his richeſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57813:60"/>
Subjects, and of <hi>London</hi> 20000 Marks. He coined abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gold and Silver Money, wherein he quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> and intitled himſelf <hi>King of England and France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having raiſed an Army of 10000 ſtout Soldiers, he imbarqued them in 200 Ships, and ſailing toward <hi>Sluce,</hi> he fortunately met with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, whereon were 40000 Men of divers Nations, whom the King fell upon with his whole Navy, and after a fierce and bloody Fight, very few of the <hi>French</hi> eſcaped, being all either ſunk or taken. This Loſs was ſo very conſiderable, that they were afraid to diſcover it to the <hi>French</hi> King, leſt it ſhould too much diſcompoſe him, and therefore they contrived his Jeſter ſhould do it, who often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating in his hearing, <hi>Cowardly</hi> Engliſhmen, <hi>Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted</hi> Engliſhmen, <hi>Daſtardly</hi> Engliſhmen; The King obſerving him, asked him <hi>why; Becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they had not the courage to leap into the Sea, as our brave</hi> Frenchmen <hi>did;</hi> whereby the King began to have ſome knowledge of this grand diſaſter. <hi>Edward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but ſmall Loſs, ſo that the next day he landed at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and ſoon after beſieged <hi>Tournay;</hi> but by the importunity of the aforeſaid Counteſs of <hi>Heynault</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Truce was concluded for one year.</p>
               <p>In King <hi>Edward</hi>'s abſence, the <hi>Scots</hi> diſliking their King <hi>Edward Baliol,</hi> becauſe he would not engage againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and calling in <hi>David Bruce,</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Northumberland,</hi> deſtroying all before them, and laying cloſe Siege to <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> but at Midnight 200 reſolute Men iſſued out, and ſecretly entred into the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Tent, ſeiſing him, and killing many, to the great terrour of the <hi>Scots</hi> Camp: whereupon <hi>David</hi> finding ſtout Reſiſtance, raiſed the Siege, and marched to <hi>Durham,</hi> which he took, plundred, and burnt, ſlaying all the Inhabitants, and then ſate down before <hi>Roxborough</hi> Caſtle, defended by the beautiful Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and her Brother Sir <hi>William Mountague,</hi> who being continually aſſaulted, expected no Help but from the King: and to give him notice of their Extremity, the valiant Knight himſelf, mounted

on a ſwift Horſe, rid full ſpeed through thouſands of his Enemies, ſending word to King <hi>David</hi> as he rid along, That in a ſhort time he ſhould again hear of him. Upon which the <hi>Scots</hi> puſhed on the Siege with all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, yet could not carry it, and therefore ſuddenly raiſed it, and returned home. King <hi>Edward</hi> arriving there that very day, was much diſcompoſed that he had miſſed them; yet by the Mediation of ſeveral Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſonages, a Truce was concluded for two years. The King, after the <hi>Scots</hi> were gone, diſarmed himſelf, and with ten or twelve Perſons of Quality entred the Caſtle, where he was ſoon inflamed with the Love of the fair Counteſs; but her Vertue reſiſted all Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo that he departed from her in Diſcontent.</p>
               <p>The King then made a Royal Feaſt for all his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Forreigners that came thereto, wherein were acted ſeveral Martial Sports in one of which the Lord <hi>Beaumont</hi> a Noble Knight was unfortunately ſlain. After this the King called a Paliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein he created his eldeſt Son <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and a Tax was raiſed for the Wars in <hi>France,</hi> for which the King confirmed <hi>Magna Charta, Charta de Foreſta,</hi> and ſeveral other Statutes.

King of <hi>Scotland</hi> invaded <hi>England</hi> with an Army of 50000 men, by the procurement of the <hi>French</hi> King, but the Queen with 12000 ſtout Souldiers, fought with him, routed his Army, took King <hi>David</hi> Priſoner, and ſeveral other Perſons of Honour, killing divers more, and above 15000 <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Victory, the Queen attended with a Troop of handſom Ladies and Gentlewomen, whoſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands or Kinſmen had long lain at the Siege of <hi>Callice,</hi> ſailed thither, and were entertained by the King and his whole Army with great joy; the Town being deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of Relief, begged the Kings mercy, which he denied unleſs ſix of the chiefeſt Citizens came out to him in their Shirts, barefoot, and bareheaded with Halters about their Necks, to be diſpoſed of at the Kings pleaſure, which hard condition ſome of them undertook to perform, preſenting the King with the Keys of the Town and Caſtle, which <hi>Edward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, commanded them to be all preſently hanged, but his Commanders interpoſed ſtrongly on their behalf, which yet could not prevail, the King threatning to make them examples for the wrongs done to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation at Sea; at length the Queen with Prayers and Tears on her Knees procured their Pardon. The King having got poſſeſſion of this important Town, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>England,</hi> and was received at <hi>London</hi> with great Triumph; and by the Popes means a Truce was concluded with the <hi>French</hi> for two years; which being expired, <hi>Edward</hi> ſent a ſtrong Army under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Son the Black Prince into <hi>Gaſcoyn,</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in their march.</p>

the utmoſt conduct of the valiant K. <hi>John,</hi> they were put to the rout, the King and his Son being taken Priſoners, who being brought before the Prince, he bowed to the King, and giving him comfortable words, feaſted him and his Son <hi>Philip</hi> very nobly, and lodged him in his own Bed. With this Prize the Black Prince returned into <hi>England,</hi> and was joyfully received by all. In this Fight were taken ſeventeen Earls, above fifty Lords, and a multitude of Knights and Gentlemen of Quality, ſo that every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier who had leaſt had two Priſoners, all which with the Spoil of the Field, the Prince freely gave the Souldiers, and every man had Gold and Silver in abundance, coſtly, Armour and other valuable things, being left on the ground as worth nothing.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John</hi> lived ſome time at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and after at <hi>Windſor,</hi> being as kindly treated by the King as he could deſire; and after four years Impriſonment a Peace was concluded, whereby it was agreed, That King <hi>John</hi> ſhould pay 500000 <abbr>

About two years after, three Kings came at once to viſit King <hi>Edward, John</hi> King of <hi>France, David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the King of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The next year the <hi>Black Prince</hi> went into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conqueſts, who aſſiſted <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and reſtored him to his Crown, of which he was diſpoſſeſſed by his Baſtard brother <hi>Henry;</hi> but ſoon after <hi>Henry</hi> with freſh Forces ſuddenly fell upon King <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeiſed him, and put him to death.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The King much diſturbed at theſe Misfortunes, called a Parliament, wherein the Temporalty freely gave him a Subſidy of 15000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> but the Clergy denied him any Supply; whereupon he removed them from all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Offices, and placed more grateful Subjects in their room. The <hi>French</hi> King had now beſieged <hi>Rochel</hi> almoſt a year, for whoſe Relief a Fleet was ſent under the Earl of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> but he was fought with by <hi>Henry</hi> the Baſtard of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Earl, with 160 more, taken Priſoners; the reſt with much terrour and difficulty eſcaped to <hi>England.</hi> Upon the News of this Defeat ſeveral other Towns and Provinces revolted to the <hi>French</hi> King.

In his firſt year, <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> preſuming on his Minority, being aſſiſted by the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> landed in <hi>England,</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Towns of <hi>Plymouth, Dartmouth, Portſmouth, Rye,</hi> and others on the Sea; and would have proceeded further, had they not been encountred by the Earls of <hi>Cambridge, Buckingham,</hi> and others, who beat them back to their Ships.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time a valiant <hi>Scot,</hi> named <hi>Alexander Ramſey,</hi> (at the inſtigation of the <hi>French</hi> King) with only forty men deſperately ſcaled the Walls of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Caſtle,</hi> and finding the Captain and Guards ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they took it without blows, deſigning to have taken the Town too, but the Inhabitants from the great noiſe in the Caſtle, ſuſpecting miſchief, cut down the Stairs of the Drawbridge on the Townſide, ſo that when the <hi>Scots</hi> let it fall, the Chains broke, and the Bridge fell into the Caſtle Ditch, whereby the <hi>Scots</hi> not being able to get out, were made Priſoners by their own Victory. They then endeavoured to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Caſtle, but it was ſoon beſieged and taken by K. <hi>Richard</hi>'s Forces, who gave quarter to none but only <hi>Ramſey</hi> their Captain.</p>
               <p>Soon after the <hi>French</hi> again landed in <hi>England,</hi> doing great miſchief at <hi>Dover, Winchelſey, Haſtings,</hi> and <hi>Graves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi> where they got much Booty. To prevent and revenge theſe injuries, a Parliament was called at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> wherein four Pence was laid upon every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57813:64"/>
above fourteen years old, the levying whereof cauſed a dangerous Rebellion under <hi>Jack Straw, Wat Tyler, John Wall</hi> a Factious Prieſt and others, who ſtiled themſelves <hi>The Kings Men,</hi> and <hi>the Servants of the Commonweal of</hi> England, declaring <hi>that all Men ought to be equal in Dignity and Eſtate, as being all the Sons of</hi> Adam; they marched through ſeveral Countreys to <hi>London,</hi> the mean ſort of People joyning with them, ſo that they became very formidable, committing all manner of Inſolencies, and making bold demands of the King, and the Lord Mayor, which ſo incenſed the Mayor, that he ſtruck <hi>Tyler</hi> off his Horſe with his Sword, where he was killed immediately, upon which the Rebels who were above 20000 ſoon diſperſt, no leſs than fifteen hundred being Executed for the ſame, with ſeveral cruel Deaths and Torments in divers parts of the Realm. And thus in an inſtant vaniſhed this great cloud which threatned the deſtruction of King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In his tenth year, the King forſaking the advice of his graveſt and moſt experienced Nobility, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to commit many illegal and diſorderly Actions by the Counſel of <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> his Chancellor, <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alexander</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Robert Treſillian</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice, who without cauſe exaſperated him againſt the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> his Uncle, and the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> whom they intended to ſurpriſe at Supper, if <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Exton</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> would have aſſiſted them: But failing herein, they reſolved to impeach them in Parliament; but they being jealous of the Kings intent, came thither ſtrongly guarded; while they were on their way, in a Wood near the Court, the King asked the Opinion of ſeveral about him, what he ſhould do in the caſe, at length he merrily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of one Sir <hi>Hugh Liun,</hi> who had been a good Souldier in his days, but was now diſtracted, what he would adviſe him to do; <hi>Iſſue out,</hi> quoth Sir <hi>Hugh, and let us ſet upon them and kill every Mothers Son, and when thou haſt ſo done, by Gods Eyes thou haſt killed all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57813:65"/>
the faithful Friends thou haſt in</hi> England. But K. <hi>Richard</hi> doubting the ſucceſs of any violent courſe, that Deſign was defeated, and the King demanding a great Tax of four fifteens, is not only denied, but ſeveral miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors of his Government are declared to him, and at length <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> his favourite is by the Lords found guilty of many offences, Condemned, Fined, and Impriſoned, and Commiſſioners were appointed to examine the Crimes of all the Kings Officers, the King taking an Oath not to recal that Commiſſion without conſent of Parliament, and it was enacted, <hi>That all thoſe who ſhould perſwade the King to infringe the ſame, ſhould for the ſecond offence ſuffer as Traytors to the King and Kingdom.</hi> Notwithſtanding which this Parliament was no ſooner ended, but <hi>Pool, Vere Treſillian</hi> and others, perſwaded him, contrary to this Solemn Oath, to aſſemble the Judges at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and the thirteen Commiſſioners and divers others to be guilty of High Treaſon, for compelling the King to ratify the Commiſſion under his Great Seal; which Judgment they confirmed under their Hands as agreeable to the Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Truce with <hi>France</hi> being ended, that King ſent 1000 Perſons of Quality into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who joyning with their Army of 30000 they therewith invaded <hi>England,</hi> committing many violences; but hearing King <hi>Richard</hi> was marching toward them, they turned into the craggy Mountains of <hi>Wales</hi> doing much miſchief to the Inhabitants, and in the mean time K. <hi>Richard</hi> entred <hi>Scotland</hi> with 68000 men, burning and deſtroying <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinborough,</hi> St. <hi>Johnſtons, Sterling, Dundee</hi> with many other places, and then returned home. The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French</hi> returning, found little or no ſuſtenance by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the late ruins, ſo that the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were forced to return home without Horſes, Arms or Money, but the Admiral and ſeveral Grandees were kept as Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by the <hi>Scots</hi> till the <hi>French</hi> King had ſatisfied the loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and damages which they had ſuſtained meerly for his ſake, upon whoſe account they entred into this
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57813:65"/>
War; whereupon he was forced to ſend what Money they demanded, to redeem his Commanders.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King vowing Revenge againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for theſe Diſgraces, prepared a very great Army, which he deſigned to tranſport into <hi>England</hi> in a Navy of no leſs than 1200 Ships: Againſt whom King <hi>Richard</hi> ſoon raiſed vaſt Forces, conſiſting in above 100000 Men. But all theſe mighty Preparations ſoon came to nothing; for the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers, in their March toward the Ships, committed ſuch horrid Inſolencies, that they were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and curſed by the Inhabitants, who did them all the miſchief poſſible, and hid their Proviſions from them, ſo that they were forced firſt to ſell their Arms, then their Horſes, and laſt of all their Clothes, to keep themſelves from ſtarving; after which, the <hi>French</hi> King finding how odious they were to the People, and not being able to give them freſh Supplies of Money and Victuals, he ſuddenly diſbanded them, and loſt his Honour, his great Hopes, and Money, all at once.</p>
               <p>After this, the Barons humbly beſeech the King to confirm his former Oath, and to expell thoſe wicked Counſellors afore-mentioned, and baniſh thoſe flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Judges, who to pleaſe him had ſubſcribed ſuch Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Opinions; but the King abſolutely denied their Requeſt: Whereupon, to prevent their own and the Kingdoms Ruine, as they declared, they raiſed a ſtrong Army of their Friends and Abettors, wherewith they marched toward <hi>London,</hi> with full reſolution to have thoſe former Laws confirmed: Upon which thoſe vile Favourites fled all to the <hi>French</hi> King for Aid againſt the Lords. The King having tried the Affections of his People, and finding they would not fight againſt the Barons, eſpecially the <hi>Londoners,</hi> ſeemed to agree with the Lords, aſſuring them, he would call a Parliament, wherein thoſe Favourites ſhould anſwer to all charged againſt them; and if convicted, ſhould ſuffer ſuch Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as they ſhould judge fit. This unexpected Condeſcenſion ſo highly contented the Lords, that they returned the King hearty Thanks and preſently diſbanded all their Forces; but the Kings Mind was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57813:66"/>
ſoon altered, for he permitted <hi>Robert Vere</hi> Duke of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to raiſe 5000 Men for the Guard of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which the Lords obſerving, they in an inſtant got their Confederates together, and ſuddenly encompaſſed the Duke and his Army near the <hi>Thames,</hi> ſo that he was forced to ſwim croſs on Horſeback, from whence he preſently fled into <hi>France,</hi> where about five years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as he was hunting, he was ſlain by a Wild Boar.</p>
               <p>Yet ſuch was the Affection of the King toward him while he lived, that he cauſed his dead Carcaſe to be embalmed, and brought into <hi>England,</hi> and to be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in Princely Robes and Ornaments, putting about his Neck a Chain of maſſy Gold, cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing his Fingers with Rings, and ſolemnizing his Funeral with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Pomp and Magnificence. But to return: After the Duke had eſcaped as aforeſaid, the Barons executed ſeveral of his chief Companions, for terrour to others, but commanded the Multitude to return home with all ſpeed; and then marching to <hi>London,</hi> were highly treated and enterta ned by the Citizens. The King, who kept his Court in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> was now willing to admit of a Conference with the Lords, where it was concluded, That a Parliament ſhould be called; who being met, the Kings Counſellors and Judges were condemned for High Treaſon againſt the King and Kingdom; <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Brem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> were beheaded, and <hi>Treſillian</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice was hanged at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and the reſt of the Judges had ſuffered the ſame Fate, had not the importunate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Queen changed it into Baniſhment. And thus were all things in a great meaſure ſetled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>The next year the <hi>Scots</hi> invaded the Land, and did much miſchief; but by the Diſcretion of the States a Truce was concluded for ſeven years: And ſoon after, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> raiſing a ſtrong Army, tranſported them into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he demanded the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in the Right of his Wife <hi>Conſtance,</hi> eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Peter</hi> the depoſed and ſlain King; and, with the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

many great ſervices, forcing the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſue for peace, who married <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the Dukes El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Daughter by his ſaid wife, and gave him eight Waggons loaden with maſſy Gold, paying alſo ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Marks yearly, to him and his Dutcheſs during their Lives.

               <p>In his ſixteenth year the uſurped Juriſdiction of the Pope was abridged, for it was enacted in Parliament; <hi>That the Popes pretended Authority within this Kingdom, ſhall thenceforth ceaſe, and that no appeal upon any Account ſhould be made to the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the penalty of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Impriſonment,</hi> and <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of <hi>Lands and Goods, In his</hi> ſeventeenth year his virtuous Queen <hi>Ann</hi> died, and two years after K. <hi>Richard</hi> married <hi>Iſabel</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth of <hi>France,</hi> upon which a peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betwixt both Nations for Thirty years, and K. <hi>Richard</hi> raſhly delivered up the ſtrong Town and Caſtle of <hi>Breſt</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Brittain,</hi> which much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contended the Nobility eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Kings Uncle, who plainly told him, <hi>That it was not convenient to deliver up that without blows, which his Anceſtors had gained with ſo much expence of blood;</hi> whereas the King inraged, reſolved upon revenge, and therefore hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all manner of falſe informations againſt him, and among others he was told, <hi>That the Electors deſigned to have choſen him Emperor of</hi> Germany, <hi>had not his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle and others repreſented him as altogether unfit and unable to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern an Empire, who could not rule his own Subjects at home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This falſe ſuggeſtion ſtill aggravated the Kings Anger againſt the Lords, ſo that under pretence of friendſhip, and with the breach of his Oath and honour, he cauſed the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> to be ſuddenly apprehended, and then ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning a Parliament, Sir <hi>John Buſhie</hi> Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, a man of a proud and inſolent Spirit, in a long ſpeech magnified the King, profanely attributing to him the higheſt Titles of Divine Honour,

               </p>
               <p>The King likewiſe procured both Houſes of Parliament, to grant full and abſolute power, to ſix or eight ſuch Perſons as he ſhould nominate to enact and determine what they ſhould think Convenient in all cauſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many miſchievous things were decreed to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Kingdom; and to pleaſe his Guard, who were moſt <hi>Cheſhire</hi> men of mean birth and fortunes, he ſtiled himſelf Prince of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> as if that were more honourable then to be King of the Realm; and to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe things, honours were beſtowed upon divers Noble-men; his Couſen <hi>Henry Bullingbroke,</hi> Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> Son and Heir apparent to the Kings Fourth Uncle, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Hereford;</hi> his Couſen <hi>Edward</hi> Plantaginet Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and ſeveral others were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; He alſo granted free pardon to all but fifteen, whom he ſhould name, whereby he kept the Nobility in fear and awe, ſo that if any offended him, he would declare him to be one of the fifteen, and put his life upon Tryal for pretended Treaſon. It happened about this time that the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> hearing daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Kings miſgovernment, and his extream arbitrary and illegal proceedings, he privately diſcloſed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57813:67"/>
his grief thereat to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to inform the King thereof, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to be more favourable to the Lords, who were with too great ſeverity condemned for High-Treaſon.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> regarding more his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, then the Common good, reſolved to riſe by the fall of his friend, and therefore told all to the King, with the moſt malicious and aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances imaginable, whereat the King inraged ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned his Couſen to anſwer, who freely acknowledged what he had privately, and friendly deſired might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but denied the falſe ſuggeſtions added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and challenged the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to a ſingle combate to vindicate himſelf, which was accepted and conſented to by the King, but when the day came, and they entted the Liſts for fight, the King would not ſuffer them to proceed, but baniſhed the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> for ever, who ſoon after died, at <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> for ſix years, who went into <hi>France,</hi> and was honourably received by that King, and not long after his Father <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> died, and the King unjuſtly ſeized all his honours and eſtate into his hands, which he divided among his Flatterers and Minions, which unworthy act ſo much diſpleaſed his Uncles, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Albemarl,</hi> that they left the Court, and retired to their own Houſes.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the King was wholly miſled by the lewd conduct of <hi>William Scroop</hi> Earl of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> Sir <hi>James Bagot</hi> Sir <hi>John Buſhie,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Green,</hi> by whoſe advice, without conſent of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he raiſed a great Army, farming the whole Revenues of his Kingdom to theſe his favourites for ſeveral years, and ſailing into <hi>Ireland,</hi> wholly ſubdued that rebelling Nation; but in his abſence, <hi>Henry</hi> now Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> (with his old friend <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) returned to <hi>England</hi> to claim his Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and landing in the North, great numbers of armed Troops admiring his Nobility and virtues, joined with him, ſo that within a few days
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57813:68"/>
he marched to <hi>London,</hi> and was there received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with much joy. King <hi>Richard</hi> returning, ſoon raiſed great Forces, which he conducted againſt the Duke, but perceiving his Subjects daily revolt from him, and hearing that his three unworthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites <hi>Scroop, Buſhie,</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> on whom he moſt relied, were taken, and beheaded, he voluntarily came to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and confeſſing his own inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency and weakneſs to govern well, praiſed the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Qualities of the Duke, as worthy of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, offering to reſign it to him, if he would accept thereof.</p>
               <p>Though the Duke was very willing to wear a Crown, yet hoping to have it by the free conſent of all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and People, he cauſed the King to be guarded to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and then calling a Parliament, twenty four Articles of Miſgovernment were publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged againſt the King, and ſent him by both Houſes of Parliament, who not only confeſſed them to be true, acknowledging his inability to Rule better, but by an Inſtrument in Writing under his Hand and Seal, reſigned his Crown and Kingdom to <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which being read, and generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, they depoſed King <hi>Richard,</hi> and made <hi>Henry</hi> King, and his old Friend <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> inſtalled him in the Royal Throne, <hi>Richard</hi> was then ſent to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle; but <hi>Henry</hi> fearing his Government could not be ſafe while <hi>Richard</hi> lived, he was ſoon after aſſaulted by Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Exton</hi> and eight more with Bills and Poleaxes in his lodging, and after valiant reſiſtance made, was overpowered and murdered by them in the twenty ſecond year of his Reign, and the thirty third of his Age, 1399.</p>

               <p>Theſe Troubles being ended, <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> Brother to the <hi>French</hi> King, ſent a vain-glorious Challenge to King <hi>Henry,</hi> requiring him with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtout <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to fight with him and the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>French,</hi> for Honours ſake, at a Place appointed: But the King diſcreetly anſwered, <hi>That his former war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Actions ſufficiently cleared him from the infamous Title of Coward; That Kings ought not to be ſo careleſs of their Kingdoms, or prodigal of the Blood of their Subjects, whom God had committed to their Charge, as to fight for any Cauſe, unleſs for the Defence of the True Religion, their own Rights, or to ſecure their Realms from Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and revenge their Peoples Wrongs; That a Sovereign Prince, by the Laws of Arms and Honour, was not obliged to any Challenge in the Field, except againſt one equal to him in Dignity: Yet that he would be always ready to repreſs any
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57813:71"/>
Violence or Wrong which the Duke ſhould raſhly or unadviſedly attempt againſt him or his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The haughty Duke having received this mild Anſwer, grew inraged, and immediately ſate down with a great Army before the Town of <hi>Vergie</hi> in <hi>Guyen,</hi> which he beſieged three Months, giving many fierce Aſſaults, and receiving ſuch ſtout Repulſes, that deſpairing of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he was compelled to raiſe his Siege, and return diſgracefully into <hi>France.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe judging that King <hi>Henry</hi> durſt not leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to make War abroad, deſired leave of the <hi>French</hi> King to attempt the regaining of <hi>Callice,</hi> and to that end raiſed great Strength; but the <hi>French</hi> Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil being informed of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s vaſt Preparations to defeat them, commanded <hi>Burgundy</hi> to deſiſt; which he imputed to the Pride of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> leſt he ſhould gain more Honour than himſelf.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was <hi>Henry</hi> freed from this Danger, but another preſently ſucceeded, contrived by <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Richard Scroop</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York, Thomas Mowbray</hi> Earl-Marſhal, the Lords <hi>Haſtings, Faulconbridge, Bardolf,</hi> and others; but the Conſpiracy being privately revealed, he unexpectedly marched with an Army into the North, and ſurpriſed all the Lords except <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Bardolf,</hi> whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately beheaded. <hi>Northumberland</hi> fled into <hi>France,</hi> and from thence came back a while after into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he was promiſed Aid againſt the King; but Prince <hi>Henry</hi> being ſent thither, burnt and deſtroyed all before him, taking in the Caſtles of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and forcing the <hi>Scots</hi> to beg for Truce, which was granted them for a few Months onely: But three years after, <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Bardolf</hi> animating the <hi>Scots</hi> to a new War, entred <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and did much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: Whereupon King <hi>Henry</hi> raiſed Forces to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them; but before his coming they were routed by Sir <hi>Ralph Rooksby</hi> Sheriff of the County; and the two Lords with divers others being taken, they cut off their Heads, and ſent them for Preſents to the King. After which, till his Death, which hapned in two years,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57813:72"/>
he enjoyed Peace and Quietneſs, and then died at <hi>London</hi> of an Apoplexy, having reigned Thirteen years and five months, and lived Fifty ſix, 1412. and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> In his Admonition to his Son at his Death, he ſpake thus: <hi>As long as</hi> Engliſhmen <hi>have Wealth and Riches, ſo long ſhalt thou have Obedience from them; but when they are Poor, they are ſtill ready for Commotion and Rebellion.</hi>

He executed the Laws with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon his People; and to prevent any Irruptions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Welch,</hi> he built divers Forts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles on the Frontiers, Garriſon'd with ſome thouſands of ſtout Soldiers.</p>

Motion, the fat Abbots and Priors, the idle Monks, wanton Fryars, and whining Nuns, joyntly beſeeched the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to be their Friend who in a Learned Oration diſcovered the Kings Right to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> propoſing an eaſie Method for attaining thereto; and laſtly, as a more prevailing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he offered the King, as a free Gift from the Clergy, an incredible Sum of Money, for furthering him therein.</p>
               <p>This Propoſal laid all thoſe Petitions aſleep, being approved of both by King, Nobles, and People, and nothing was diſcourſed of but <hi>Englands</hi> recovering of <hi>France:</hi> To which purpoſe, the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> the Kings Uncle, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> High Admiral, and the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> attended with 500 Horſe, were ſent Ambaſſadors to the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth, who in the Kings Name requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the peaceable Surrender of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> with the entire Dutchies of <hi>Aquitain, Normandy, Anjou, Poictou,</hi> and <hi>Mayn;</hi> propoſing, <hi>That if without effuſion of Blood the</hi> French <hi>King would yield to his Demands, he would then vouchſafe to take his Daughter</hi> Katherine <hi>in Marriage, and would endow her with all the afore-mentioned Provinces, and allow the</hi> French <hi>King all Honour and Reſpect: But if he refuſed to deliver his Patrimony without Blows, he would then endeavour to gain it by the Sword, wherein he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his People would ſuffer all the Calamities of a War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King and Nobility were much ſurpriſed at this unexpected Meſſage, and therefore deſired time to deliberate on ſo weighty an Affair; but the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> the Kings eldeſt Son, deſpiſing the Youth and unlikely Attempt of King <hi>Henry,</hi> ſent him as a Preſent a Tun of Tennis-balls, as more agreeable to his Years; which <hi>Henry</hi> receiving, ſaid, <hi>That he would ſhortly ſend him ſuch</hi> London-<hi>Balls, as ſhould ſhake</hi> Paris <hi>Walls;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſoon levied a ſtrong Army.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57813:73"/>
have with her a conſiderable ſum of money, and ſome ſmall Territories in <hi>France;</hi> but the King returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that Unleſs <hi>Aquitain Normandy, Anjou,</hi> and all the other ſmall Seigniories, were delivered to him, as juſtly appertaining to his Crown, he would neither disband his Army, nor wave his Title to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> but would attempt to gain it by fire and Sword.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were gone, the King having left conſiderable forces upon the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and provided all things neceſſary, ſent his Letters of defiance to the <hi>French</hi> King, and was juſt imbarking for his voyage, when at that very inſtant, a dangerous conſpiracy was diſcovered, either to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him up to the <hi>French,</hi> or murder him in his Tent, contrived by <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>York, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Scroop,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> three of the moſt valiant Commanders in his whole Army; who being apprehended, and brought into his preſence freely confeſſed the whole contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and that they were corrupted by rewards from the Dauphin; upon which they were the next day executed as Traytors. The Wind ſerving the King tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his Army into <hi>Normandy,</hi> in an hundred and forty ſhips, and the Town of <hi>Harflew</hi> being delivered to him after a ſeige of thirty ſeven days, was ranſomed from plunder by the Citizens, with great ſums of Gold and Silver; the King then reſolved to march to <hi>Callice</hi> through the very Borders of <hi>France,</hi> though the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin had an Army of thirty thouſand, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were only two thouſand Horſe, and thirteen thouſand Archers, many of them wanting health, victuals, and ſleep, and having plenty of nothing but ſilver and Gold, which in that place would not give them the leaſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of what was truly neceſſary for preſerving their Lives.</p>
               <p>It much diſturbed the <hi>French</hi> King, who lay at <hi>Roan,</hi> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould march on thus without control, and therefore he ſent K. <hi>Henry</hi> a defiance, and that he would be with him in a few days, and accordingly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57813:74"/>
bringing an Army of threeſcore thouſand Horſe into the Field, incamped near a Town called <hi>Agen-Court,</hi> making great jollity the night before the battel, as aſſuring themſelves of the victory, being ſo very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo inconſiderable and ſickly; on the contrary K. <hi>Henry</hi> and his little Army ſpent the night in Prayers and Devotions, as knowing that they muſt either conquer valiantly or dye baſely; upon <hi>Fryday, Oct.</hi> 20. 1414. The battel began, wherein both ſides fought with great courage, but at length K. <hi>Henry</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a glorious victory, there being ſlain, the High Conſtable and High Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Alanſon Brabant and Bane,</hi> thirty four Earls and Lords, eight thouſand Knights, Eſquires and Gentlemen, and about ſixteen hundred Common Souldiers, beſides ten principal Dukes and Lords taken Priſoners; on King <hi>Henry</hi>'s ſide were not ſlain above ſix hundred Souldiers, and two Commanders. After this K. <hi>Henry</hi> marched ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Callice,</hi> where having refreſhed themſelves they took ſhipping for <hi>England,</hi> being inriched with Gold, Silver and coſtly armour in abundance, and the King was received with all manner of Joy and Triumph into <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King was extreamly troubled at this great overthrow, but the Dauphin eſpecially, inſomuch that he died, as was thought for meer vexation ſoon after; The Earl of <hi>Arminiach</hi> being made High Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> the Kings Uncle, Governour of <hi>Harflew,</hi> underſtanding he was going that way with ſome forces, ſuddenly iſſued out upon him, and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his whole party; which ſo inraged the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, that with all ſpeed he beſieged <hi>Harflew,</hi> on every ſide with five hundred ſhips at the mouth of the River <hi>Seyn,</hi> which K. <hi>Henry</hi> having notice of, he preſently ſent a ſtout Army imbarked in two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships, who falling upon the <hi>French</hi> Fleet in ſight of the Town, utterly deſtroyed them with a vaſt ſlaughter of men, and thereby forced the Conſtable immediately to raiſe the ſiege, and King <hi>Henry</hi> then calling a Parliament, and declaring to them his right
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57813:74"/>
to <hi>France,</hi> they freely gave him great ſums of money, wherewith ſailing into <hi>Normandy,</hi> he won the ſtrong Town of <hi>Caen;</hi> in the mean time ſuch private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels aroſe between the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, as much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged K. <hi>Henry,</hi> who daily won the chiefeſt Towns in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and then laid a formal ſiege to the great City of <hi>Roan,</hi> which was ſtrongly fortified, and well provided, ſo that K. <hi>Henry</hi> gave many terrible aſſaults in vain; upon which being informed that there were above two hundred Thouſand Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren within the Walls, he reſolved to gain it by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine without blows, and to that end caſting a deep ditch about the City, pitched full of ſharp ſtakes and guarded with Archers, the Inhabitants could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſs in nor out, ſo that in two months time, the Famine increaſed ſo grievouſly, that the Citizens drunk nothing but Vinegar and Water, and were forced to eat Rats, Mice, Cats, Dogs, and Horſes; and the poorer ſort being turned out, periſhed miſerably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Gates and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trenches; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſtill growing more outragious, they ſent four Knights, four Scholars, and four of their chief Burgeſſes cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all in black, as Commiſſioners to the King, who ſpake to this purpoſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The King having with ſome trouble, heard this bold Oration, he preſently returned this undaunted Anſwer. <q>Proud &amp; vain glorious <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> Do you imagin that I am ſo weak a Scholar in the Art of War, as not to have yet learned the principles thereof, are not the Sword, Fire and Famine, the three principal Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherewith the moſt renowned Kings and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Captains have ever, and do ſtill endeavour to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their enemies; and being joined together, are they not able to conquer the ſtouteſt nation in the World; it was my goodneſs and Clemency, that I did not aſſault your walls with my Sword, becauſe I would not willingly be the death of any, but thoſe who wilfully ſeek their own deſtruction, neither do I intend to conſume ſo fair a Jewel as this City is with Fire, but deſire to preſerve it, as being my own Right and Inheritance; if I then uſe the mildeſt of the three, that is Famine to correct you, and bring you to reaſon, you may if you pleaſe quickly free your ſelves from it by delivering this City into my hands, which if you ſhall obſtinately refuſe; I will make you ſenſible that every impudent, talking fellow, is not fit to inſtruct Princes in martial affairs, neither ought bookiſh, unexperienced Plebeians to read warlike Lectures to me who am their enemy; you deſire, nay you ſaucily require, that your ſick and ſtarved People, may paſs into the Country through my Army, and then if I dare I may aſſault your Town; the World will certainly wonder at your cruelty, who have barbarouſly and uncharitably thruſt out of your Gates multitudes of innocent poor diſtreſſed People, of your own blood, kindred, and Country, on purpoſe that I ſhould unmercifully kill and deſtroy them, yet ſuch hath been my mercy, that I have often relieved and ſuccored them, but ſince I find your obſtinacy ſtill continue, I henceforth reſolve not to give them any comfort, and if they periſh with Famine, as they needs muſt, God will require their blood at your
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57813:75"/>
Hands, who would moſt wickedly expoſe them to theſe calamities, and not at mine, who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly preſerve them if I could have my right; be you therefore aſſured, that ſince you remain ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate, they ſhall not paſs through my Army, but die at your Gates, unleſs your hard Hearts yield them ſome pity. And when I ſee cauſe I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault your Town to your coſt, but will not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected how, nor when, by you; in the mean time I would have you know, that he who does thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, and march through the very bowels of your Countrey, he who hath already taken as ſtrong though not ſo great Cities as this, and he who with the death and deſtruction of your chiefeſt Nobles, Captains, and moſt valiant men at Arms, hath forced his way thus to beſiege your Town, dares alſo, if he pleaſe, aſſault it, and doubts not in the leaſt to win it when he ſhall think fit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King having thus ſpoke ordered that the <hi>French</hi> Commiſſioners ſhould Dine with his great Officers of State, and with a frowning Countenance turned from them; after Dinner the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> conſulting among themſelves humbly begged of the King a Truce for eight days to conſult what was to be done, which the King, naturally inclined to Clemency, freely granted, during which daily conferences paſſed between both partys, but nothing was concluded; upon which the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men deſired only one day more, which was frankly aſſented to, in which the Common People hearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done, fell into a dreadful mutiny, and threatned to cut their Commanders Throats, for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to ſtarve like Dogs for their own pleaſure, and therefore they forced them to deliver up this great and ſtrong City. The <hi>French</hi> being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned at theſe diſaſters, a Treaty of Peace was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, in which K. <hi>Henry</hi> being denied all his demands, was very angry, and told the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Kingdom, <hi>That he would have the Princeſs</hi> Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine <hi>to Wife, and all thoſe Countreys and Provinces he required, or elſe he would drive both his Maſter and himſelf

               <p>The Dauphin having notice thereof went to his old Friend the Earl of <hi>Arminiach</hi> late Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> who eſpouſed his cauſe, and aſſiſted him with Men, Money, and Arms, and ſoon after the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> the Kings Brother meeting with a Body of his Forces, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſly informed of their ſtrength by a trecherous <hi>Lombard,</hi> he fell upon them, but was overpowered and ſlain, with ſeveral other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Noblemen, and near two thouſand Common Souldiers.</p>
               <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> was much grieved with this unexpected overthrow, reſolving to be revenged of the Dauphin and his adherents, and to that end called a Parliament, who gave him a plentiful ſupply, but becauſe it would be long in gathering, he pawned his Crown to his Uncle the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> for 20000 pounds, with which ſoon raiſing an Army of 30000 ſtout Men, he lands at <hi>Calice,</hi> with <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> K. of <hi>Scots,</hi> he took ſeveral Towns from the Dauphin, who not daring to venture a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, fled from place to place, deſigning to tire out the Kings Army in purſuit of him; about which time K. <hi>Henry</hi> had notice that his Q. <hi>Katharine</hi> was delivered of a Son at <hi>Windſor,</hi> upon which with a Prophetick Spirit, as was judged, he ſaid, <hi>I</hi> Henry <hi>born at</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth

In a little while the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is removed, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> is put in his Place by the Council of <hi>England;</hi> and from henceforth the Affairs in <hi>France</hi> ſucceeded worſe every day, which was occaſioned by the Wiſdom of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, who grew ſenſible of their miſerable Diviſions, and now united againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Another Reaſon was, the unhappy Marriage of the King with <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Reyner</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> a poor Prince, ſo that he had nothing with her; and which was worſe, King <hi>Henry</hi> was obliged by the Articles of this Marriage to give to her Father all his Right and Title to the Counties of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Mayn,</hi> which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon <hi>Normandy,</hi> and much weakned the Kings Army, ſo that ſoon after all <hi>Aquitain</hi> was loſt.

               <p>The Queen having taken the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed him and divers others, whoſe heads ſhe cauſed to be ſet upon the walls of <hi>York,</hi> in deſpight of that party; which was fully revenged in a ſhort time upon the King, Queen and Prince, and a great number more of the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> faction.

               <p>In his third year K. <hi>Henry</hi> travelling toward <hi>London</hi> in diſguiſe, was taken in the North, and being brought to King <hi>Edward,</hi> was committed cloſe Priſoner to the Tower.

yet it proved very unſatisfactory to his Subjects, and unfortunate to himſelf; for the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> having News thereof, was extreamly diſpleaſed at ſo great an affront, and ſecretly contrived miſchief againſt him, to whom the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who had been diſobliged by his Brother, joyned himſelf, and married <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Daughter, and ſoon after with other great Lords and Confederates, they raiſed a Rebellion in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and were ſo ſtrong that at <hi>Banbury</hi> King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Forces were overthrown and 5000 of them ſlain, the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> the Queens Father, and the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> being beheaded.

               <p>Then <hi>Richard</hi> and his Confederates removed all the other Officers and Servants from about him, declaring that thoſe Noblemen who ſuffered, had reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Lords of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Blood. The Queen hearing of the fatal Murder of her Brother, Son, and Friends, repented her diſbanding the Soldiers by <hi>Richard</hi>'s cunning Perſuaſions, and fearing the Event, ſhe, with her five Daughters, and her youngeſt Son <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> took Sanctuary at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The young King alſo mourned extremely at the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Slaughter of his Friends; but the two Dukes of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> endeavoured to comfort him, expreſſing their Loyalty by a thouſand Proteſtations, and bringing the King toward <hi>London,</hi> he was met by the Lord Mayor and above 500 grave Citizens, before whom <hi>Richard</hi> behaved himſelf with ſo much reverence and ſubmiſſion to the King, that he perſuaded them, as well as the Council of State, to declare him Protector of the King and Kingdom, which was the great thing he aimed at; but not having the Duke of <hi>York</hi> in his Hands, he grievouſly complained againſt the Queen, for detaining him as a Priſoner, and hindring him from keeping company with his Brother; which he enforced with ſo many plauſible Reaſons, that the Council ſent and commanded her to deliver him up, which ſhe unwillingly did, kiſſing, and weeping bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly over him, praying God to deliver him from all danger, and telling the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who was ſent for him, <hi>That ſhe would require that poor and innocent Child at his Hands.</hi> When the lovely Youth was put into the Protector's Hands, he before the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly took him in his Arms, kiſſing, hugging, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, and often ſolemnly proteſting upon his Soul, That nothing in the World except the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

was ſo dear to him as that young Child, though he then deſigned to ſacrifice them both to his curſed Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition: And bringing the young Duke to the King, who was extremely pleaſed with his Company, he conveyed them through <hi>London</hi> with great Pomp and State to the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon pretence of Security in theſe troublous Times, whenas there were no Troubles but what were occaſioned by himſelf, and his wicked Accomplices.</p>
               <p>Having thus betrayed theſe poor innocent Lambs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Slaughter houſe, <hi>Richard</hi> then contrives how he might moſt commodiouſly Butcher them.

Hereupon he called a great Council of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> propoſing to them the ſpeedy Coronation of the King, though it was leaſt intended by him; and then grew very pleaſant with the Lords, and told Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> whom he loved not, <hi>That he heard he had fine Strawberries in his Garden in</hi> Holbourn, intreating him to ſend for ſome; which he willingly did, being very glad the Protector was ſo kind to him.</p>
               <p>Upon a ſudden <hi>Richard</hi> riſes from the Board, deſiring the Lords to proceed in the Matters before them, and that he would go out, and return again preſently; which he did within an Hour after: And being ſet in his Chair, he bent his Brows, bit his Lips, wrung his Fiſts, and looked fiercely on the Ground.

The Lords being abſolutely innocent, ſate like Men amazed, not one of them uttering a Word; at length, the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who was moſt familiar with him, replied, <hi>Thoſe that have tranſgreſſed the Law, deſerve the ſevereſt puniſhment thereof:</hi> To which all the Lords aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>The Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> who ſince <hi>Edward</hi>'s Death had taken <hi>Shore</hi>'s Wife for his Concubine, and having left her that Morning in his own Bed, endeavoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his Rage againſt her, and ſaid, <hi>My Lord, If the Queen and ſhe have ſo done</hi>— The Protector furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly interrupting him, <hi>Thou Traytor,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>doſt thou tell me of</hi> If<hi>'s and</hi> And<hi>'s?

eminent Citizens, to whom he declared with great paſſion, <hi>That the Lord</hi> Haſtings <hi>and his Confederates had conſpired to take away his Life this Morning at the Council, had he not timely prevented it by the ſudden Execution of him, and ſeiſing the reſt.</hi> Within two hours after the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi>'s his death, a long Proclamation, written fairly in Parchment, under the Great Seal, was read in divers parts of the City by an Herald at Arms, with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; whereby it appeared to be contrived and written ſome days before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> having thus diſpatcht thoſe that he thought ſtood in his way, he cauſed <hi>Dr. Shaw,</hi> a wicked Prieſt, in a Sermon at <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Croſs</hi> the <hi>Sunday</hi> after, to diſplay the Honourable Birth of the Protector, with his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Valour, and to defame King <hi>Edward</hi> for his Wantonneſs with <hi>Shore</hi>'s Wife, and others, and ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized his Children for Baſtards, as being before his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage contracted to <hi>Elizabeth Lucy.</hi> He likewiſe charged the Protectors own Mother with Incontinency, when King <hi>Edward</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> were born, and that none of her Children were Legitimate but <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> whom he extolled to the Skies for his Goodneſs and Virtues; at which time <hi>Richard</hi> appeared among the People, the Doctor expecting they ſhould have ſhouted, and cried, <hi>God ſave King</hi> Richard; but every one ſtood ſilent, and aſtoniſhed, to obſerve how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily and villainouſly things were managed to make the Protector King.

               <p>The Biſhop having by theſe and many other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confirmed <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in his Reſolution of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting againſt <hi>Richard,</hi> he then prevailed with him, to let him go into the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> from whence he fled to the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> King <hi>Richard</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice hereof, ſent many rich gifts and preſents to the Duke of <hi>Brittain</hi> to deliver up <hi>Richmond</hi> to him, but could not prevail, and tho the Plot of the Biſhop was very ſecret, yet <hi>Richard</hi> had intelligence thereof, and reſolved to take off <hi>Buckingham,</hi> either by fair or foul means, and therefore ſent for him kindly to Court, but the Duke knowing that <hi>Richard</hi> never ſpared the Blood of any who ſtood in his way, ſent ſubmiſſive excuſes, as not being able to travel; the King ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his ſickneſs was more in mind than body, and therefore ſent Letters full of threats, peremptorily commanding him to come; the Duke rather deſiring an open enemy, than a falſe friend, boldly returned anſwer; <hi>That he would not venture his life in the hands of ſuch a Monſter, Murtherer, and uſurping Tyrant as he was;</hi> and thereupon preſently fled to Arms, raiſing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable forces in <hi>Wales,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Courtrey</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> did the like in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Guilford</hi> and others in <hi>Kent,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>

               <p>Richard preparing an Army, marched with all ſpeed to meet <hi>Buckingham,</hi> before he joined with his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who reſolving to confront him deſigned to bring his Army over the <hi>Severn</hi> to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but the night before it rained extreamly, &amp; continued ſo to do for ten days after, which cauſed a very great flood, and laid all the Country under water, drowning Towns, Villages, and abundance of People; this delay cauſed ſcarcity in the Dukes Army, upon which the inconſtant <hi>Welch,</hi> ran away and left him alone, ſo that he was forced
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57813:90"/>
to fly to one <hi>Humfry Baniſter</hi> near <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> for ſecurity, he having been his Servant, and raiſed by the Duke to a handſome eſtate; the Lords hearing of the Dukes ill ſucceſs, got to Sea and arrived ſafely in <hi>Brittain; Richard</hi> offered a thouſand pound to any who ſhould diſcover the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> upon which that ungrateful Wretch delivered him up, and without any Legal Tryal, he was inſtantly beheaded.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Richmond</hi> hearing nothing of theſe misfortunes, having got together about five thouſand men, imbarqued them for <hi>England,</hi> but was beaten back by a ſtorm, and much ſhattered; yet being relieved by the <hi>French</hi> King, he ſoon after got into <hi>Brittain,</hi> where he met his noble friends, by whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to attempt landing in <hi>England</hi> once more, <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> ſwearing to marry <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> K. <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths eldeſt Daughter; But K. <hi>Richard</hi> to prevent the match, perſwaded the old Queen with large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and great ſums of money to deliver her five Daughters into his cuſtody, and ſoon after he cauſed it to be reported, that his own Queen was dead, which ſhe hearing of, was much troubled, and in a week after was found dead indeed; which <hi>Richard</hi> ſo little regarded, that he preſently made love to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who conſidering her own and Siſters dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, durſt not deny him abſolutely, but perſwaded him to ſtay till he had defeated the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and ſetled himſelf in Peace.</p>
               <p>At this time his Court flatterers perſwaded him, that <hi>Richmond</hi> and his Party received ſuch ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and aſſiſtance from the <hi>French</hi> King, that he was unable to make any attempt againſt him, which <hi>Richard</hi> readily believed, and therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the forces which were in <hi>Garriſon,</hi> on the Sea Coaſts, whereby it pleaſed God to infatuate the councel of this Bloody Politician; &amp; to bring him to his deſerved fate: for ſoon after by the aid of the young <hi>French</hi> King, the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> with a very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, landed at <hi>Milford</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he ſaw little appearance of aſſiſtance, but the <hi>Welchmen</hi> being

And having a Diſpenſation from the Pope, he married the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> his Brother Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Widow. To oblige his People, he made open Proclamation, That he would hear the Complaints againſt <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley;</hi> and finding they had committed notorious Rapines on his Subjects, he cauſed them to be beheaded at <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and their Confederates were Pilloried in ſeveral Places of the Kingdom. At this time the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth made War with the Pope, whereupon <hi>Henry</hi> offered himſelf a Mediator, but was rejected by the <hi>French</hi> King, and therefore proclaimed War againſt <hi>France;</hi> upon which occaſion, and for writing againſt <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> the Pope ſtiled him <hi>Defender of the Faith. Henry</hi> ſending a Fleet and an Army thither, took the Towns of <hi>Tyrwin</hi> and <hi>Tournay.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>James</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Scots,</hi> though he had married <hi>Margaret</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s eldeſt Siſter, contrary to his Oath and Articles, invaded <hi>England</hi> with an Army of 100000 Fighting Men; but the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> with 26000 Men marching againſt them, utterly routed the whole <hi>Scotch</hi> Army at <hi>Flodden field,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> himſelf being ſlain valiantly fighting.

               </p>
               <p>And now Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> of mean Parentage, grew extreme Great, by the Kings extraordinary Affection toward him; and among other extravagant Actions, he procured a Licenſe from the Pope to pluck down ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57813:96"/>
ſmall Abbies and Priories, and to ſettle the Lands upon two Colleges which he had built, one in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and another in <hi>Oxford;</hi> which Preſident occaſioned King <hi>Henry,</hi> ſome years after, to pull down all the reſt.</p>
               <p>In his eighth year a Riot hapned in <hi>London</hi> againſt Merchant-Strangers, and Artificers, for which many were condemned of High Treaſon, but were all pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the King. The Truce with <hi>France</hi> was ſoon broken by the <hi>French</hi> King, whereupon King <hi>Henry</hi> ſent an Army thither, who won and burnt <hi>Morlaix,</hi> and ſeveral other Towns, returning home with great Booty.</p>
               <p>In his twentieth year the Kings Marriage with Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> is queſtioned, which was thought to be cunningly contrived by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey;</hi> whereupon the King refrained her Bed, and it was judged unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by ſix Foreign Univerſities: ſo that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes Oppoſition, who would have had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to him, it was made null and void by the next Parliament; upon which the Pope cauſed his Curſe to be ſet up at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> againſt the King, pronouncing the Marriage lawful: But <hi>Henry</hi> little regarded thoſe Paper Pellets; for hereby the Pope loſt his Supremacy in <hi>England,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> were beheaded for defending it. The King ſoon after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Ann Bullein,</hi> Daughter to the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> who was judged a Favourer of Proteſtants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſliked by Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> who for abundance of Miſdemeanours was found guilty of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and all his Eſtate and Honours were taken from him, for grief whereof he ſoon after died.</p>
               <p>In his twenty ſixth year the King was by Parliament declared Supreme Head of the Church, within all his own Dominions, in all Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes; and all Popiſh Bulls and Indulgences were made void, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Religious Houſes of Nuns and Monks, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue exceeded not 200 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a year, were ſuppreſſed. The next year Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> the Kings dearly-beloved Wife, was beheaded, though ſhe proteſted her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency at her death, being accuſed for proſtituting her Body to her own Brother the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> who
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57813:96"/>
with ſome others were put to death for the ſame.</p>
               <p>This Tragedy being over, the King within twenty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> days married <hi>Jane</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>John Seymour,</hi> by whom he had the Virtuous Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him; but within few days after the good Queen died. <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> being ſlain, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, his Queen, <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldeſt Siſter to King <hi>Henry,</hi> was afterward married to <hi>Archibald Dowglas</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who had a Daughter by her called <hi>Margaret;</hi> this young Lady the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> married without the Kings leave, for which, ſhe being of the Blood Royal, he was beheaded as a Traytor. The Kings Proceedings againſt the Pope cauſed a Rebellion in <hi>Lincolnſhire;</hi> but they were ſoon diſperſed, and Captain <hi>Cobler</hi> their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with others, executed. This was no ſooner ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, but an Inſurrection begun in the North, of above 40000, who called themſelves <hi>The Holy Pilgrims;</hi> but upon the Kings Pardon, they all quietly departed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In his twenty eighth year ſeveral Perſons were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for denying the Kings Supremacy, and the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> is made Vicegerent in all Spiritual Matters, by whom all Images and Shrines in Churches were taken down and deſtroyed, and the Houſes and Lands of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Priors, Monks, and Nuns, for their many Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours, were all taken away, and their yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, amounting to above 200000 <abbr>

After the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> had performed this great Buſineſs, he perſuaded the King to marry <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> whom he never liked, ſo that though he was married to her four Months, he never converſed with her as a Wife, the Clergy ſoon after diſſolving the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the King married <hi>Katherine Howard,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk.</hi> The King then began to frown upon <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:57813:97"/>
which his Enemies, who were many, obſerving, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his Downfal; for he was attainted in Parliament, and without being ſuffered to defend himſelf, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed for High Treaſon; and about this time the Lord <hi>Hungerford</hi> and the Lord <hi>Leonard Gray</hi> were put to death.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> was very unfortunate in his Wives; for ſoon after his laſt Marriage, he was informed that his Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> had before Marriage lived very laſciviouſly with one <hi>Francis Derham,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peper;</hi> whereupon the Queen, and the Lady <hi>Rochfort</hi> who was privy thereto, were ſoon after attainted of Treaſon by Parliament, and beheaded; and the other two hanged at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time an Act of Parliament was made, declaring it High Treaſon to deny the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or to acknowledge the Authority of the Pope. Yet though the Diſcipline of the Church was altered, the Doctrine remained almoſt the ſame; for there were ſix bloody Articles likewiſe enacted, and it was made Hereſie, and thereupon burning, to deny any of them. They were theſe: 1. <hi>That after ſpeaking the Words of Conſecration by the Prieſt, the real and natural Body and Blood of Chriſt, as he was conceived and crucified, was in the Sacrament, and no other Subſtance.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Communion in both Kinds is not neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> 3. <hi>That Prieſts may not marry.</hi> 4. <hi>That Vows of Chaſtity ought to be obſerved by the Law of God.</hi> 5. <hi>That Private Maſſes ought to be continued.</hi> 6. <hi>That Auricular Confeſſion is neceſſary and expedient to be retained in the Church of God.</hi> The refuſal of theſe Articles cauſed the Death of very many Proteſtants, as the denying the Kings Supremacy cut off ſeveral Papiſts; ſo that at the ſame time Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were burnt on one ſide of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and Papiſts hanged on the other; which made Foreigners admire, not underſtanding what Religion King <hi>Henry</hi> was of.</p>
               <p>In his thirty third year the King married <hi>Katherine Parr,</hi> Siſter to the Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> who was likely to have loſt her Head, if her Virtue, and the Kings ſudden Death,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57813:97"/>
had not reſerved her for better Fortune; for being ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, which was forbid to be read, ſhe thereby began to hearken to thoſe who declaimed againſt the Abuſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and thought her ſelf ſo well inſtructed in her Religion, that ſhe would debate thereof with the King, who impatiently heard her, both by reaſon of the anguiſh of his ſore Leg, and becauſe he hated to be contradicted, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his old Age, and by his Wife, as he ſaid. This was ſo much aggravated by <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> a bitter Enemy to the Reformation, as being againſt the Six Articles, and the Proclamation againſt Prohibited Books, that the King gave leave to him and <hi>Wriothſley</hi> the Chancellor to draw up Articles againſt her, which they preſented to the King, and were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by him, ſo that they onely expected a Warrant to carry her to the Tower; which the Queen acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hearing of, fell into a great Paſſion, extremely bewailing her Misfortune; of which the King having notice, came himſelf to her Chamber, where compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionating her Condition, he uſed ſuch kind Words as did help to recover her; ſo that the next Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Kings Chamber, he began to talk of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; but ſhe wittily excuſing her ſelf by reaſon of the weakneſs of her Sex &amp; Judgment, ſaid, <hi>She would refer her ſelf in this, as in all other Cauſes, to his Majeſties Wiſdom. Not ſo, by St.</hi> Mary, quoth the K. <hi>you are become a Doctor,</hi> Kate, <hi>to inſtruct <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, as We take it, and not to be inſtructed or directed by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> But the Queen replying, That what ſhe ſaid was rather to paſs away the time, and make him forget his Pain, than to hold an Argument; and that ſhe hoped, by hearing his Majeſties Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, to receive ſome Profit thereby: The King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>And is it even ſo, Sweet-heart? Then are we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Friends again;</hi> and therewith lovingly kiſſed her. But her Enemies knowing nothing of this Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prepared to ſend her to the <hi>Tower</hi> the next day, according to the Kings Warrant; when ſhe being mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily talking with him in the Garden, the Lord <hi>Wriothſley</hi> with forty of his Guard came in whom the King ſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

beholding, and after calling to him at ſome diſtance from the Queen, ſo expoſtulated the matter, that at laſt he reviled him, and commanded him out of his Preſence: yet at the Kings return, ſhe humbly begged his Pardon; to whom the King anſwered, <hi>Alas, poor Soul! thou little knoweſt how ill he has deſerved this; for I aſſure thee, he has been a very Knave to thee.</hi> And thus by her opportune Submiſſion ſhe eſcaped, though <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> abſolutely deſigned her Ruine.</p>
               <p>Not long before King <hi>Henry</hi> ſailed to <hi>Callice</hi> in a Ship with Sails of Cloth of Gold, and the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> ſerved under him as a Soldier, at 100 Crowns a day. The King ſate down before <hi>Bul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This turn of Affairs put <hi>Henry</hi> upon new thoughts of uniting <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by procuring a Marriage

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Tyrone</hi> breaking into Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> got a great victory over the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and after ſome debate the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was ſent thither with ample Authority, but not meeting with expected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs he returned to <hi>England</hi> without the Queens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whereupon he was committed to cuſtody and brought to a private Tryal; but upon his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was again ſet at liberty, yet being reproached with want of Courage by ſome of the Cabal, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Malecontent and uſed all means to gain the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples love, reſolving to ſeize on the Queen, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſappointed, he retired into the City endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ingage the Citizens on his ſide, which not being able to effect, he at length ſurrendred himſelf to the Lord Admiral, and was ſent to the Tower, with his great friend the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> both whom being Try'd, were found guilty of Treaſon, and <hi>Eſſex</hi> was beheaded, but <hi>Southampton</hi> pardoned, ſeveral of their confederates being likewiſe executed.
